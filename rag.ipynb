However, teaching\\nmathematics out of such a textbook to my students seemed ineffective because many of\\nthem disliked studying mathematics unless they saw practical applications. Accordingly,\\nas an economist, I looked for other textbooks in mathematical economics. Many good\\ntextbooks were available, but they were too advanced for an introductory course, in terms\\nof both mathematics and economics. Although they contained many applications to eco-\\nnomics, they usually assumed that students have learnt some introductory economics.\\nThese applications are not straightforward for ﬁrst-year students with little, if any, back-\\nground in economics. I decided to write my own lecture notes given this unsatisfactory\\nsituation.\\nScope\\nThe material in the main text ranges from a revision of high-school mathematics to appli-\\ncations of calculus (single-variate, multivariate and integral) to economics and ﬁnance.\\nFor example: linear and quadratic functions are introduced in the context of demand and\\nsupply analysis; geometric sequences, exponential and logarithmic functions are intro-\\nduced in the context of ﬁnance; single-variate calculus is explained in the course of\\nsolving a ﬁrm’s proﬁt maximisation problem; a consumer’s utility maximisation is used\\nto motivate introducing multivariate calculus; and integral calculus is explained in the\\ncontext of calculating the deadweight loss of taxation. The material can be taught in 13–\\n15 weeks (39–45 hours). To give some ﬂexibility, matrix algebra and an introduction to\\ndifference/differential equations are covered in appendices.\\nFeatures, approach and style\\nOne of the distinctive features of this book is that, where possible, mathematical tech-\\nniques are introduced in the context of introductory economics. Many students tend to\\ndislike learning mathematics for its own sake, but this feature allows them to realise that\\nlearning introductory mathematics is inevitable in studying economics. The book is self-\\ncontained since no knowledge in economics or ﬁnance is assumed. Economic and ﬁnancial\\napplications are explained in detail before students learn how mathematics can be used.\\nFor example, in Chapter 4, various notions related to a competitive ﬁrm’s problem (from'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

Then, motivated by this problem, differential\\ncalculus is introduced. Of course the primary objective of the book is for students to learn\\nmathematical techniques, so economic ideas are not explained as comprehensively as in\\nother textbooks on introductory economics.\\nMy notes were originally written as a self-contained workbook on maths applications.\\nThe material in the workbook was not presented in an encyclopaedic way – because I\\nwanted to have something I could follow exactly – and was written in a conversational style\\nto make my students feel as if they were studying in my lectures. A typical encyclopaedic\\nquantitative methods textbook covers everything at length. It also means that such a\\ntextbook tends to contain a lot of unnecessary detail, which I think is not a desirable\\nfeature for an introductory textbook. The spirit of the workbook was ‘maths is used to\\nexamine economics and ﬁnance’, and this textbook adopts the same philosophy and the\\nconversational style. I have tried to focus on mathematical ideas that are relevant to our\\napplications in economics and ﬁnance, and have tried to remove as much unnecessary\\ndetail as possible.\\nI hope instructors ﬁnd my approach useful in teaching an introductory quantitative\\nmethods course and, where necessary, can provide their students with some details that\\nmight be missing from this book – in terms of both economics and mathematics – in their\\nlectures, which I am sure will be appreciated.\\nTarget audience\\nThe book is aimed at ﬁrst-year economics/ﬁnance students – with some high-school maths\\nbut little (or even no) background in economics or ﬁnance – who are required to take a\\nquantitative methods (calculus) course in their degrees. Any other undergraduate student\\nand/or an MBA student who has no economics background, but who is required to take\\na quantitative course in economics/ﬁnance in their degrees will also ﬁnd the book useful.\\nAlthough almost no knowledge of economics and ﬁnance is required, it is assumed that\\nstudents have a knowledge of high-school mathematics up to single-variate calculus.\\nCalculator policy, etc.\\nThe use of a calculator is strongly discouraged. Arithmetic required in this book is not\\ncomplicated enough to warrant the use of a calculator. Students who routinely use a\\ncalculator – and have difﬁculty in their arithmetic – should try gradually restraining\\nthemselves from relying on it. You won’t be able to have a good sense of numbers if\\nyou keep relying on a calculator. Moreover, we use numbers everyday when we discuss\\neconomics and ﬁnance, and it helps a lot to have good arithmetic in understanding what\\nother people are discussing.\\nSome might argue that a scientiﬁc calculator is necessary because sometimes a solution\\nmay involve expressions such as\\n√\\n, log, etc. I have come across many students who\\nare used to – with the help of a scientiﬁc calculator – providing an approximate solution\\nto these expressions. I have also seen many students who tend to round numbers to two'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

On many occasions, from a practical point of view, providing an approximate\\nsolution is permissible and could be better than providing an exact solution. For example,\\nif your boss asks you to provide him/her with a forecast of the economic growth rate of\\na country for the next year, he/she is probably looking for an answer such as ‘2.83 per\\ncent (or even 2.8 per cent)’ rather than ‘2\\n√\\n2 per cent’. The rounding error in this case\\nwill be considered trivial to your boss as well as to most people. And indeed, it is handy\\nto have a calculator in this case because it will tell you that 2\\n√\\n2 ≈ 2.828 427 (or even\\nmore accurately). But what about rounding top 100-metre sprinters’ best records to zero\\ndecimal places (in seconds)? It is not practical because too many athletes will be tied at\\n10 seconds and you won’t be able to tell the sprinter with the fastest record. On the other\\nhand, you would round top marathon runners’ best records because rounding them to zero\\ndecimal places would be enough to rank them quite accurately. Using an approximate\\nsolution is therefore considered practical and permissible depending on the context, and\\nat times a scientiﬁc calculator may be useful in getting the approximate solution.\\nHowever, there is a clear distinction between being practical and being precise, and the\\nlatter aspect is more important when you study mathematics. In mathematics we tend to\\ncarefully connect many dots to get to a solution. If every one of the dots is connected\\nimprecisely, the solution you arrive at might be quite different to the exact one (the\\ndifference may still be trivial depending on the context, but that’s not the point here).\\nTo be a good user of mathematics, it is important to conduct operations accurately and\\nobtain the exact solution at each of the required steps. In fact, in many cases, you will\\nﬁnd that only an exact solution exists. For example, when you end up with a\\nb, where a\\nand b are real numbers, there is no way that you can write it in decimals and round it to\\na particular number of decimal places! For expressions such as 2\\n√\\n2, 1\\n30 and loge 2, it is\\npossible to provide approximate solutions, but leave them as they are. As far as learning\\nmathematics is concerned, what we care about most is whether you can actually get the\\nexact solution by following the correct steps. For this reason, you will not need to have a\\nscientiﬁc calculator (or even a simple calculator) to study this book.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

In spirit, I essentially followed in the same footsteps of\\nmy former colleagues, Ben Smith, Matt Benge and Rod Tyers, who were teaching a ﬁrst-\\nyear macroeconomics course in rotation at that time. They were dissatisﬁed with existing\\ntextbooks in introductory macroeconomics and decided to write their own lecture notes,\\nwhich were also known as the brick (Ben eventually published his brick as a textbook). I\\nread the brick for the ﬁrst time when I tutored that course for Rod (in 1998 when I was\\ndoing my Ph.D.) and was so surprised how systematically and succinctly their material\\nwas put together. I would not have thought of writing my own notes without seeing their\\nteaching, so I would like to thank them for showing me their dedication to teaching good\\neconomics.\\nI’d like to express my gratitude to the many students who took my course and used\\nmy notes for giving me positive and encouraging feedback as well as some constructive\\ncriticism. Teaching that course was a great learning experience for me as an instructor\\nand it was a privilege to have been able to teach such excellent groups of students. My\\nthanks also go to all the tutors – particularly Shane Evans who provided me with valuable\\nassistance as Head Tutor of the course for several years – for their feedback, support and\\nencouragement.\\nMany people have helped me turn the lecture notes into this book. I’d like to thank\\nmy former colleague at the ANU, Chris Jones, for suggesting that I should publish my\\nlecture notes as a book and for introducing Andrew Schuller to me. I am grateful to\\nAndrew for opening up an opportunity for me to discuss this book project with Chris\\nHarrison, Publishing Director of Social Sciences at the Cambridge University Press. I’d\\nlike to thank Chris and his editorial and production team for their professional work and\\ncontinuous support. I’d also like to thank many anonymous reviewers – and again Chris\\nJones who acted as a non-anonymous reviewer – for providing me with helpful comments\\nand useful suggestions on earlier drafts.

To give you an overview of the book, in this chapter these ideas will be brieﬂy\\nexplained without the use of mathematics, primarily for readers who have little\\nknowledge of economics. I will also foreshadow various topics that will be covered in\\nthe rest of this book and the mathematical techniques that might be used to examine\\nthem.

The items you bought might include those that\\nare physically tangible, e.g. potato chips, vegetables and books, as well as those that are\\nintangible in nature such as ‘watching a movie in a cinema’ and ‘having a haircut at\\na hairdresser’s’. Economists call tangible products such as potato chips and vegetables\\ngoods, whereas they call intangible ones services.\\nGoods and services are traded in markets. If you have not studied economics before,\\nnote that the word ‘markets’ is a technical term (a jargon) and may be different from\\nhow you use it everyday. When you hear the term ‘market’ you might imagine something\\nlike a ﬁsh market or a fruit market because we are familiar with these markets. But in\\neconomics a ‘market’ is a much broader idea. For example, consider an ice-cream stand in\\na football stadium. In economics, it constitutes a market for ice-cream because ice-cream\\nis traded at the stand. Another example of a market is book stores on the Internet (such as\\nAmazon.com) where books are traded. Essentially, the market for a good (or a service) is\\na set of buyers and sellers who potentially engage in trading it, given a particular time and\\na location.\\nThousands of goods and services are traded in markets.

Imagine a situation where (a) many other sausage sellers\\nare around you and they all charge the same price; and (b) there are many people in the\\nmarket who are willing to pay that price to buy sausages. That is, so long as you charge\\nthat price, people will buy as many sausage as you want to sell.\\nTo think about how you might decide what price to charge, start with the situation where\\nyou charge the same price as others. Now, would you consider charging a higher price?\\nWell, it is not a good idea because if you did, people would buy sausages from other sellers\\nand would not buy any sausages from you. Then, would you consider charging a lower\\nprice? It is not a good idea, either. There are many people who buy sausages from you if\\nyou charge the same price as others; so why would you want to do worse by charging a\\nlower price?\\nIn this situation, it seems you have no option but to accept the price other sellers charge.\\nWhy can you not affect the price of the sausage? It is because there are so many other\\nsausage sellers in the market. When your sausage supply is only a tiny proportion relative\\nto the size of the sausage market, you cannot change the price of the sausage by yourself.\\nEach of the sellers, including you, has no control over the price and hence accepts (takes)\\nthe price that stands in the market. Economists call these sellers price takers. Similar\\nlogic applies to buyers. If each of the sausage buyers is small compared to the size of the\\nentire market, then none of them has inﬂuence on the price of a sausage. Each buyer is a\\nprice taker in such a situation. You are in this kind of situation when you are shopping in\\nthe supermarket.\\nHowever, if you are in fresh food (e.g. fruit, vegetable, ﬁsh) markets when they are\\nabout to close, you ﬁnd that you have some ‘power’ to inﬂuence the prices of the goods. It\\nis very likely you can bargain the prices down. In such a case, buyers are not price takers.\\nAn example of non-price taking behaviour on the seller’s side is found in a market where\\nthere is only one seller. The seller is called amonopolist (or a monopoly) and it can set the\\nprice as it likes (although the price is likely to be subject to government regulation). Even\\nwhen there is more than one seller in the market, each of them may have some control\\nover the price they can charge. In the above sausage example, even if there are many more\\nsausage sellers around you, if you supply sausages that are somewhat different from those\\nothers provide – e.g. sightly bigger, spicier, healthier – then you can charge a higher price\\nthan your competitors (and consumers who have particular tastes will pay more to buy\\nsausages from you).\\nIn any event, in this book we will not focus on situations where sellers and/or buyers\\nhave control over the price. It means that our focus will be the market wherehomogeneous\\ngoods are traded. There are many sellers as well as many buyers in this market and hence\\neach of them behaves as a price taker. The market that satisﬁes these two conditions –\\n(a) homogeneous goods and (b) price taking sellers and buyers – is called the perfectly\\ncompetitive market. Now let us look at how buyers and sellers might behave when the\\nprice of a sausage is given.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

The diagram indicates that when the market price of sausage is\\ngiven as $1 (remember, buyers take this price as given), buyers wish to buy 2000 sausages\\n(Point A in Figure 1.1). In other words, the quantity demanded is 2000 when the price of\\nsausage is $1. Now suppose the price has risen to $1.50 (and again buyers must take this\\nnew price as given), what will occur to the quantity of sausages buyers would like to buy?\\nYou would think it’d go down, yes?\\nNow that sausages have become more expensive than before, buyers might want to\\nsubstitute the sausages and buy something else, such as pizzas. Such an effect is called\\nthe substitution effect. In addition, an increase in the sausage price has effectively made\\nbuyers poorer, if other things – prices of other goods and buyers’ income levels – are held\\nconstant. We say that the buyers’ purchasing power has gone down.

The demand\\nschedule for sausages can be constructed by going through this exercise for every price,\\nand you will end up obtaining a downward sloping schedule as in Figure 1.1. So an\\nimportant lesson that we have learnt here is that the demand schedule slopes downwards;\\nthis is called the law of demand.\\nBy how much does the buyers’ demand for sausages change when there is a change in\\nthe price? Sausage sellers are interested in the answer to this question because it affects\\ntheir revenue from selling sausages. When all the sellers decided to raise the price by\\n50 cents, if the quantity of sausage demanded didnot change, their revenue would increase.\\nHowever, as the law of demand suggests, they will not be able to sell as many sausages\\nas before, and hence it is unclear whether the revenue will rise or fall. In Chapter 2 we\\nintroduce some basic mathematical concepts, which include functions. An example of a\\nfunction is the demand function, which mathematically represents the demand schedule\\nwe have just discussed. The question as to the change in the sellers’ revenue is more\\ncomplex and we will have to put off the investigation until Chapters 4 and 5, where we\\nlearn about differential calculus. Differential calculus is crucial in conducting economic\\nanalysis. As an application of differential calculus, we will introduce price elasticity of\\ndemand, which is closely related to the sellers’ revenue problem we have discussed above.\\nIn fact, what is behind the demand schedule is more complex than you might think.\\nWe brieﬂy mentioned in the above discussion how buyers might choose a good over\\nanother provided the prices for those goods and their income levels. It is easy to imagine\\nthat a change in the price of a sausage will affect the quantity of sausages demanded,\\nbut the prices of other goods and income levels are also important determinants of the\\nsausage demand. How does the consumer decides how much of each good to purchase?\\nIn Chapter 6, we use this buyers’ consumption choice problem as a motivation to learn\\nthe mathematical notion called multivariate calculus.\\n1.2.2 Market supply\\nThe market supply schedulein Figure 1.2 depicts, for each and every price of a sausage,\\nthe quantity sellers in the market are willing to provide (in a particular time, per day for\\nexample).\\nAs in the diagram for the demand schedule, we have price on the vertical axis and\\nquantity on the horizontal axis. The diagram indicates that when the market price is $1\\n(remember, sellers are price takers), they wish to sell 1000 sausages (PointC in Figure 1.2).\\nAnother way to put it is that the quantity supplied is 1000 when the price of sausage is $1.\\nNow suppose the price rises to $1.50 (and again sellers take this new price as given), what\\nwill happen to the quantity of sausages sellers would like to supply, holding other things –\\nsuch as sellers’ sausage production technology, how much it costs to hire a worker, etc. –\\nconstant?\\nWhen everything else is held constant – in Latin, ceteris paribus – an increase in the\\nprice of a sausage (by 50 cents in this case) will increase the quantity of sausages supplied\\nin the market.

In the diagram it is shown that the\\nquantity of sausages supplied rises to 2000 when the price increases to $1.50 (Point D in\\nFigure 1.2). The supply schedule of sausages – the upward sloping schedule in Figure 1.2 –\\ncan be constructed by obtaining the quantity supplied for all the other prices. The fact that\\nthe supply schedule slopes upwards is called the law of supply.\\nAs we learned in the beginning, there are many sellers in a competitive market and\\neach of them supplies sausages. It means that the market supply must be the sum of\\nthe supply of these individual sellers. In Chapter 4 we will study an individual seller’s\\ndecision making problem, which is to choose the quantity of supply given the price so as\\nto maximise proﬁts. It is called the proﬁt maximisationproblem and we will learn how\\nto differentiate a function in the course of solving this problem. In Chapter 7 we will\\ndemonstrate how we can aggregate the individual seller’s supply schedules to obtain the\\nmarket supply schedule.\\n1.3 Market equilibrium\\nNow let us put the two schedules together in Figure 1.3.\\nBoth the market demand and supply schedules for sausages are depicted. Remember\\nthat each of the buyers is a price taker and so is each of the sellers. The diagram indicates\\nthat when the market price of a sausage is given as $1, buyers wish to buy 2000 sausages\\n(Point A in Figure 1.3), but sellers wish to sell 1000 sausages (Point C). The horizontal\\ndistance CA (measured in sausages) is 1000 and it means the quantity demanded exceeds\\nthe quantity supplied by 1000 sausages if the price is $1.

But how do we reconcile it with the price\\ntaker assumption? The assumption is that each seller cannot raise the price because they\\nwill lose all their sales given other sellers are not deviating from the current price. Here\\nthe trick is to think as follows; we suppose all the sellers agree to increase the price by a\\nlittle bit at the same time. When sellers realise that there are desperate buyers who would\\npay a bit more to buy sausages (rather than missing out on them), they decide to raise the\\nprice as a group, which creates an upward pressure on the price. There will be an upward\\npressure on the price from the buyers’ side as well. Namely, the buyers who do not want\\nto miss out on sausages will offer a higher price (if they can), which the sellers have no\\nreason to decline.\\nLet us see what might occur if the price is $1.50. Now buyers wish to buy 1000 sausages\\n(Point B), but sellers wish to sell 2000 sausages (Point D). So there is excess supply,\\nwhich is represented by the horizontal distance BD. The quantity supplied exceeds the\\nquantity demanded by 1000 sausages if the price is $1.50. This time there will be a\\ndownward pressure on price. That is, realising the excess supply, buyers as a group bid\\ndown the price, which sellers tend to accept so as to unload the excess supply.\\nWe have looked at the cases where the amount buyers want to buy does not coincide\\nwith the amount sellers would like to supply. Now focus on Point E in Figure 1.3 where\\nthe price of a sausage is $1.25. The demand schedule indicates that buyers wish to buy\\n1500 whereas the supply schedule shows that sellers would like to provide 1500 to the\\nmarket. So under this price, the amount buyers want to buy coincides with the amount\\nsellers would like to supply. When this occurs we say that the sausage market clears\\nand that the market is in equilibrium. It is the situation where (a) each of the buyers\\nand sellers is doing what they want to do; and (b) the quantity demanded equals the\\nquantity supplied, i.e. the market clears.

The numbers we use to count things, i.e. 1, 2, 3,...\\nare called natural numbers (or positive integers). If we sum two natural numbers,\\nwe have another natural number (say, 5 + 8 = 13). However, if we subtract one natural\\nnumber from a smaller one (say, 5 − 8), we end up with a negative of a natural number\\n(5 − 8 =− 3). The negative of natural numbers, that is,−1, −2, −3 ... are callednegative\\nnatural numbers(or negative integers). The set of these two types of numbers andzero\\nare called integers.\\nNow, what occurs if we multiply an integer by another? We obtain an inte-\\nger. For example, 5 · 8 = 40 or 3 · (−7) =− 21. Note that · in between two num-\\nbers implies a multiplication symbol ×,i . e .5 · 8 = 5 × 8 = 40. Sometimes we even\\nomit ‘ ·’ if it is not confusing. For instance, if we multiply two numbers x and\\ny, we can write the product as x × y, x · y or xy. Of course, you should avoid\\nwriting 58 to represent 5 · 8 because people will no doubt interpret it as ‘ﬁfty-\\neight’.\\nIn any event, let’s turn to division. If we divide an integer by another (with one exception,\\nwhich we will see shortly), we obtain a different type of number called fraction.F o r\\ninstance, 3 ÷ 2 = 3\\n2. The set of fractions and integers is called rational numbers.W e\\nwill introduce other types of numbers in due course.\\n2.1.1 We cannot divide a number by zero!\\nSuppose you have $120 in your pocket and are thinking about going to a rugby game\\nin the local stadium. Tickets cost $12 per person. How many friends can you invite?\\nWell, 120 divided by 12 gives 10, so you can invite 9 people (10, if you are not\\ngoing with them). OK, but what if tickets cost $0? How can we divide 120 by 0?\\nObviously there is no sensible number for this question, because you can choose any\\nnumber of people to take (so long as the stadium does not collapse because of over-\\ncrowding!). Mathematics disallows imprecision as such by simply excluding the idea\\nof dividing a number by zero. Consider an expression x ÷ (y − z). This expression\\nis completely ﬁne so long as y ̸= z.I f y = z, then it becomes x ÷ 0, which is not\\nallowed.\\n2.1.2 Reciprocal\\nConsider a number x. So long as x ̸= 0 we can divide 1 by x to create a new number 1\\nx .\\nIt is called the reciprocal of x. You can see thatx · 1\\nx = 1, which says that the product of\\na number and its reciprocal is unity.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

For example:\\n3\\n10 = 30\\n100,\\n5\\n16 = 3125\\n10 000.\\nHowever, they can also be written as:\\n3\\n10 = 0.3,\\n5\\n16 = 0.3125.\\nThese numbers, 0.3 or 0.3125, are called decimal numbers. The advantage of using\\ndecimal numbers is that we can compare numbers very easily. It is obvious that 3\\n10 is\\nsmaller than 5\\n16, once we see that the former is 0.3 and the latter is 0.3125. However,\\nit is not really an advantage. We can always ﬁnd any common denominator of the two\\nnumbers and compare their numerators. In the above example, if we use 10 000 as the\\ndenominator, the numerator for 3\\n10 is 3000, which is smaller than 3125, so we can reach\\nthe same conclusion rather easily.\\nIn contrast, the downside of using decimal numbers is quite notable, which I’d like to\\nemphasise. It is important to appreciate that many fractions actually do not have a nice\\nand short decimal number representation. For example:\\n1\\n3 = 0.333 33...\\nYou can see that 3 is repeating inﬁnitely. This number can be represented as 0 .˙3,\\nmeaning that 3 is repeating. The representation is actually nice and short, but that is not\\nthe point here, as you will see as you read through the rest of the section. This kind of\\nnumber is called an inﬁnite decimal, whereas numbers such as 0.3 and 0.3125 are called\\nﬁnite decimals.\\nA rational number is either a ﬁnite decimal or an inﬁnite decimal that repeats. There\\nare some inﬁnite decimal numbers that do not repeat. They cannot be represented by\\nany fraction of two integers and are called irrational numbers.

The error can be trivial or signiﬁcant\\ndepending on the context of the question of the focus, and a small discussion on this matter\\nis provided in the Preface of this book. To avoid the imprecision and, more importantly, to\\nbecome good with dealing with numbers, I encourage that you restrain yourselves from\\nusing a calculator.\\nLet’s get back to the main issue. The numbers we have discussed so far are called thereal\\nnumbers. The real numbers are either rational or irrational numbers. Rational numbers\\ninclude integers because any integer divided by one is that integer and is represented as a\\nfraction (e.g. 5= 5\\n1 ).

In other\\nwords, if we ignore the minus sign,−100 has a greater magnitude than 1 does. We use an\\nabsolute valueto show the magnitude of a numbera, which is written as|a|. In the above\\nexample, |−100| > |1|. The interval −2 <a< 2 can be expressed using the absolute\\nvalue as|a| < 2.\\n2.5 Powers\\nY ou will encounter thepower of numbers in mathematics everywhere. Let us begin with\\nthe deﬁnition of a power. If we multiply a numberq by the same number, the expression\\nwill be q × q. Another way of expressing it isq2, where the superscript 2 is a power\\nshowing that two qs are to be multiplied together. In a sense, the power expression is\\nlike slang in a language; expressing the same thing in a different way. Just like you need\\nto know slang to be an expert in a particular language, you need to know the power\\nexpression if you want to communicate well with others using mathematics.\\nIn any case, let us go through the following process to see if we can learn something\\nabout the power expression. We know that multiplying a number by unity yield that\\nnumber itself, so let us expressq\\n2 as “a 1 multiplied byq twice,”\\nq2 ≡ 1 × q × q.\\nBy the same token, we can deﬁneq to various powers:\\nq3 ≡ 1 × q × q × q,\\nq1 ≡ 1 × q,\\nq0 ≡ 1.\\nTwo things are worth noting. First,q is actually q1 but the superscript 1 is omitted for\\nsimplicity. Second, whatever the valueq takes, we ﬁnd thatq0 = 1.\\nWe can extend this analysis to division and ﬁnd out what negative powers look like.\\nNamely, for non-zeroq:\\nq−1 ≡ 1 ÷ q = 1\\nq ,\\nq−2 ≡ 1 ÷ q ÷ q = 1\\nq2 ,'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

(2.3)\\n2.5.2 Non-integer powers, particularly 1\\n2\\nUp to this point, m and n were implicitly treated as integers and hence numbers were\\nraised to some integers. But numbers need not be raised to integers only and the power\\nrules can be applied for non-integers as well. To delve into this issue, let us look at the\\nfollowing statement:q\\nn = y. It follows from rule (2.3) that:\\nqn = y\\n1\\nn ×n =\\n⎞\\ny\\n1\\nn\\n⎠n\\n,\\nand hence:\\nq = y\\n1\\nn ≡ n√y.\\nThe above identity says that ‘q is thenth root ofy’.\\nThere are two special (or frequently used)ns. When n = 2, we say ‘q is the square\\nroot of y’. It follows from the convention thatq2 is calledq-squared. As you may know,\\nwe can simply write it asq = √y (instead of 2√y). In turn, whenn = 3, we say ‘q is the\\ncube (or cubic) root of y’. It again follows from the convention thatq3 is calledq-cubed.\\nTwo remarks should be made regarding this introduction of non-integer powers. First,\\nthe number deﬁned by a statement maynot be unique. For example, 9 can be written\\nas 9 = 3 × 3 = 32 as well as 9 = (−3) × (−3) = (−3)2. So the statement q2 = 9 can\\nmean eitherq = 3o rq =− 3. In general, we write it asq =± 3. Second, if we consider a\\nstatement such asq2 =− 16, we realise that there exists no ‘real’ numberq that satisﬁes the\\nstatement. Mathematicians get away with this problem by ‘imagining’ that such numbers\\nexist, and we introduce theseimaginary numbersin the next section. But before that, let\\nme discuss a little about some conventions regarding the square root.\\n2.5.3 Some conventions on the square root\\nThere are two conventions concerning the square root that I want you to follow. Using\\na language metaphor, I would say that your mathematics will become more ﬂuent by\\nfollowing these conventions.\\nThe ﬁrst convention is the following. When we end up with an expression with a square\\nroot of ‘a number multiplied by a squared number’, simplify the expression so that the\\nnumber inside the squared root cannot be expressed as ‘a number multiplied by a squared\\nnumber’. For example, do not leave the expression\\n√\\n4 as it is. It be expressed as\\n√\\n22 and\\nhence can be simpliﬁed to 2. A little more complicated example is\\n√\\n120.

For example, when you end up with1\\n√\\n2\\n, then do not leave it.

For example,\\nconsider the expression 3x − 6, wherex is the unknown. The expression can be reduced to\\n3(x − 2). Both 3 andx − 2 are factors of 3x − 6. In general,ax + ab = a(x + b), where\\nin the examplea = 3 andb =− 2.\\nThere are some well-known rules for factorising polynomials when the highest power\\nthe unknown is raised to is two.

Y ou can obtain\\nRules 3–5 as special cases of Rule 2.\\nWhen the highest power is three, things become a little more complicated. Let us think\\nabout the following polynomial expression:\\n2x3 − x2 − 2x + 1 = (x − 1)(2x − 1)(x + 1).\\nThere is virtually only one tip you need to know in conducting this factorisation. That\\nis the following.\\nIf you observe a particular number, sayx∗, that reduces the expression to zero (i.e. the\\nexpression becomes zero if you plug inx∗ to x), then you know that one of the factors\\nmust be (x − x∗).\\nIn the above expression, for example, if we plug inx∗ = 1t o x, then the expression\\nreduces to zero: 2(1)3 − (1)2 − 2 (1) + 1 = 2 − 1 − 2 + 1 = 0. Therefore, (x − 1) is one\\nof the factors of 2x3 − x2 − 2x + 1 as you can see.\\nKnowing the tip I have given above, however, is not enough. We know (x − 1) is one\\nof the factors of 2x3 − x2 − 2x + 1, but how can we verify that 2x3 − x2 − 2x + 1 can\\nbe factorised as (x − 1)(2x − 1)(x + 1)?

Y ou can show\\nthat two expressions are equal (or not) in two ways. One is to calculate each expression\\nseparately (as in the solution above) and check if the two expressions are identical. The\\nother is to calculate the difference between one expression and the other. If the difference\\nis zero, then you have shown that the two expressions are equal (otherwise you have shown\\nthat they are not equal). Never start your solution by writing down the equality of the two\\nexpressions, i.e. assuming that they are equal. If you assume something that you want to\\nshow, then your answer is destined to be tautological.\\n2.9.3 Coordinate plane\\nMuch of economic analysis relies on the use of diagrams on which various schedules,\\nsuch as demand and supply schedules, are drawn. In the following subsections (and in\\nChapter 3), we will introduce various types of function and describe them on diagrams.\\nAs a preparation, we will ﬁrst establish the coordinate plane and related ideas.\\nRecall the real line we discussed previously. If we place another real line on top of it\\nand pivot one of them anti-clockwise around zero, then we have two real lines intersecting\\nperpendicularly at the zeros as in Figure 2.2. The plane made by these two lines (just\\nimagine placing a piece of paper on the two lines) is called thecoordinate plane. The\\nhorizontal line is called thehorizontal axis and the other one is called thevertical axis.\\nThe intersection of the two axes is called theorigin.\\nLet us think of the case wherex is taken on the horizontal axis andy is taken on the\\nvertical axis. When you draw the coordinate plane, it is important that you write down\\nwhat you take on the two axes. Otherwise people who see it have no idea what you are\\ntrying to explain. Once you take the variables on the two axes, though, we can make the\\nfull use of the convenient feature of the coordinate plane, i.e. we can represent all points\\nthat lie on it. Take PointA in Figure 2.2 as an example.

The horizontal\\ndistance is 5 and it is to the positive direction ofx, and the vertical distance is 3, which is\\nagain to the positive direction ofy. So we can describe that point as (5, 3) orA(5, 3). The\\nhorizontal distance comesﬁrst in the brackets and the vertical distance enterssecond.\\nWhat about B? The horizontal distance from the origin is 4 to thenegative direction\\nof x, and the vertical distance is 3 to the negative direction of y. Hence Point B is\\ndescribed as (−4, −3). All the points that lie on the plane can be described, like these\\nexamples, by the coordinates or the ordered pair. It is called theordered pair because\\nthe order is important (ﬁrst and second are italicised for that reason). Points C and D\\non Figure 2.2 correspond to the ordered pairs (3, 5) and (−3, −4), respectively, and you\\ncan see that they are different from Points A and B. Let me just note here that the\\nthree words, ‘coordinates’, ‘ordered pair’ and ‘point’ will be used interchangeably in this\\nbook.\\nThe two axes divide the coordinate plane into four regions, which are calledquadrants.\\nWe often refer to theﬁrst quadrantin which all the points (x,y ) displayx> 0 andy> 0.\\nThe position of each quadrant is given in Figure 2.2. In passing, points on either of the\\naxes do not belong to any quadrant.\\n2.9.4 Linear functions: a straight line\\nSuppose the functionf (x) is given as\\nf (x) = ax + b, (2.9)\\nwhere a and b are the real numbers anda ̸= 0. This function is called thelinear function.\\nIf you take x on the horizontal axis and f (x) on the vertical axis and plot all points\\n(x,f (x)) on the coordinate plane, what will you come up with? The curve you see on the\\ncoordinate plane is called thegraph of this function. A little more formally, the graph of\\na function is the set of all ordered pairs (x,f (x)).\\nIn fact, the graph of a linear function is astraight line. Let me show you an example\\nof sketching a graph of a linear function. We use the following linear function:C(q) =\\n10q + 30. The coordinate plane we look at therefore is the (q,C (q)) plane.\\nFirst we can ﬁgure out the points where the function intersects the horizontal and\\nthe vertical axes. They are called the horizontal intercept and the vertical intercept,\\nrespectively. For the horizontal intercept, the value of the function is zero, so by solving\\n0 = 10q + 30 we getq =− 3. So the horizontal intercept is (−3, 0). The vertical intercept\\nis (0, 30) because whenq = 0, C(0) = 30. Why do we care about these intercepts? It is\\nbecause to determine a straight line, we only need to obtain two points that are on it, and\\nthese intercepts are easy ones to obtain. In any event, we can now sketch the line we want,\\nas in Figure 2.3.\\nNote that, by specifying the two intercepts on the diagram, we are implicitly specifying\\nthe slope of the function, which isa = 10. It is because we can ﬁgure out the slope of the\\nfunction from these two points. Namely, when the run of the function is 3, the rise of it\\nis 30. The slope of a line is given by the dividing the rise by the run, so we get 10 as the\\nslope.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

Which variables are on the axes?\\nDrawing a straight line that goes through the two intercepts works as long asb takes a\\nnon-zero value. But whenb = 0, the horizontal and vertical intercepts are identical – yes,\\nit is the origin – so it is obvious that you cannot graph the function in the same manner.\\nSince you know that the function goes through the origin in this case, one more thing you\\nneed to specify in the graph is the slope of the function (which isa) (or another point that\\nthe graph goes through, which will enable us to ﬁgure out the slope of the function). For\\nexample, Figure 2.5 shows the graph off (x) = x.\\nY ou can see that the ﬁgure is not to scale. However, by specifying the coordinates (1, 1),\\nI can understand that the slope of the straight line is unity. This line is often referred to as\\nthe 45-degree line. It is because the angle made by the horizontal axis and this line is 45\\ndegrees. Since the graph is not to scale, the perceived angle is less than 45 degrees.\\nWhat happens whena = 0 in Equation (2.9)? It becomesf (x) = b. This says that the\\nfunction takes a valueb no matter what the value ofx is.

An important point here is that solving these quadratic equations is\\nidentical to obtaining the horizontal intercepts of the relevant quadratic functions (why?).\\nWe can see in Figure 2.7 that the quadratic function may or may not have horizontal\\nintercepts. This corresponds to the fact that the quadratic equation may or may not have real\\nroots. For example, we have seen previously that the quadratic equationx\\n2 − 2x + 8 =\\n0 does not have any real roots (it has two complex roots; see Subsection 2.8.2). The\\ncorresponding quadratic function,h(x) = x\\n2 − 2x + 8, as you can see in Figure 2.7, does\\nnot have horizontal intercepts.

Instead, the curve approaches the axes\\nasymptotically. That is, the curve will come closer and closer to the horizontal axis as\\nx becomes larger and larger; and will become closer and closer to the vertical axis as\\ny becomes larger and larger.

Suppose thatt is also a function\\nof another variable, sayx, so we can writet = g(x). Then it is obvious that the value of\\ny now depends upon the value of x, and this relationship is expressed as y = f (g(x)).\\nThe function deﬁned this way is called a function of a function. We may also view it as a\\ndecomposition of a functiony = f (g(x)) into y = f (t) and t = g(x).\\nWe can make two important remarks from the following exercise.

We will discuss the multivariate function in the context of a consumer’s\\nutility maximisation problem in Chapter 6.\\n2.10 Simultaneous equations: the demand and supply analysis\\nNow we are able to discuss the demand and supply analysis using mathematics. As\\nexplained brieﬂy in Chapter 1, when we describe the quantity demanded for a good (q)a s\\na function of its price (p), it is called thedemand function. The following is an example\\nof a linear demand function. Note that bothq and p have a power of one:\\nq = 160 − 2p. (2.11)\\nY ou should be able to see that as the price of the good rise, the quantity demanded\\ndeclines. It is useful to solve Equation (2.11) for p, because in the demand–supply\\ndiagram the price is usually taken on the vertical axis. The above equation can be written\\nas Equation (2.12), which we call theinverse demand function:\\np = 80 − 1\\n2 q. (2.12)\\nTurning to the supply side, the supply function expresses the quantity of the good\\nsupplied (q) as a function of its price (p). For example, if we postulate a linear relationship\\nbetween them, we may describe the supply function as follows:\\nq =− 80 + 2p. (2.13)\\nIf we solve Equation (2.13) forp, it becomes:\\np = 40 + 1\\n2 q. (2.14)\\nThis function is called theinverse supply function.\\nWe saw in Chapter 1 that, in the competitive market for a particular good, demand and\\nsupply interact with each other, and as a consequence the price and the quantity traded are\\ndetermined. We use the following numerical example to describe how they are determined.\\nIn doing so, we will distinguish the quantity demanded from the quantity supplied; we\\ndenote the former byq\\nD and the latter byqS:\\np =− qD + 5. (2.15)\\np = 3qS − 7.

This is where quantity\\ndemanded (qD) is equal to quantity supplied (qS). As we discussed in Chapter 1, this point\\nis calledequilibrium. The price that equates demand and supply is called theequilibrium\\nprice and is often denoted byp∗.\\nI also explained in Chapter 1 that PointE is called equilibrium because there is no\\nincentive for any parties to move from it once the price is set there. The other side of the\\nsame coin is that at any other price levels thanp\\n∗, incentives for both buyers and sellers\\nto move from the status quo exist. If you can explain the incentives, then you may skip\\nreading the following two paragraphs. Otherwise, let us recap them.\\nSuppose that the current price is above the equilibrium price, i.e.p>p\\n∗. If this is\\nthe case, as we can see in Figure 2.10, there is an excess supply of the good. Under\\nthis situation, sellers tend to lower the price in order to unload extra goods, and at the\\nsame time, buyers tend to bid the price down realising the excess supply. As a result,\\nq\\nD will rise, qS will fall, and the excess supply will be reduced. The excess supply is\\neliminated when the price equals p∗. On the other hand, if the current price is below\\nthe equilibrium price, i.e. p<p ∗, there is an excess demand of the product. This\\nshortage leads buyers to bid the price up. Sellers who realise the shortage will also\\nraise the price.

Consider the following system:\\n{2y − 3x = 8 (2.24)\\n−3y + 2x =− 7. (2.25)\\nYou could solve this system by using the method of elimination by substitution. For\\nexample, if we solve Equation (2.24) for y, we get y = 1\\n2(3x + 8). Substituting it into y\\nin Equation (2.25) will yield an equation inx only, and you can solve it forx. Some of you\\nmight ﬁnd taking these steps tedious, and for those of you, I introduce another method.\\nLet us multiply the both sides of Equation (2.24) by 3 (remember, multiplying the both\\nsides of the equality by the same number retains the equality). We also multiply the both\\nsides of Equation (2.25) by 2 (not 3). Then we get the following system:\\n{6y − 9x = 24\\n−6y + 4x =− 14.\\nThe reason we multiplied both sides of the two equations as above is to create the\\nterms 6y and −6y. Now consider adding each side of the two equations. On the LHS, we\\nhave 6y − 9x + (−6y + 4x) =− 5x (the 6ys cancel out and get eliminated). The RHS\\nis 24 + (−14) = 10, so we get −5x = 10. It follows that x =− 2. Substituting it back\\nto one of Equations (2.24) or (2.25) yields y = 1. Hence the solution of the system is\\n(x,y ) = (−2, 1). This method involves eliminating one variable by adding one equation\\nto the other, so it is called the method of elimination by addition. You can use either of\\nthese two methods to solve a system of two linear equations.\\nIn any event, let’s get back to our demand and supply analysis. By solving the simulta-\\nneous equation, we have shown that the equilibrium price for our problem is p\\n∗ = 2. At\\nthis price, demand is equal to supply (q∗ = 3). The important features of our problem are\\nthat both of the equations are linear and that there is a unique solution.\\nHowever, in general, as we have seen, systems of equations may not have a solution,\\nor even when it exists, it may not be unique. Furthermore, in more complicated systems\\n(remember, we have looked only at a system of two linear equations), solutions may\\nbe difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Linear equations are the easiest to solve, but there is no reason for\\nequations to be linear. In general, we cannot ﬁnd analytical solutions for systems of non-\\nlinear equations, and hence we often resort to numerical simulations. You need not worry\\nabout this case in this book, but just be aware of the fact that there are a number of systems\\nof equations that are analytically unsolvable.\\nSome non-linear systems are, however, solvable. Let us look at the following demand\\nand supply model. Suppose that the inverse supply function of apples is described as\\nfollows (we use the same notation as before):\\np = q\\nS + 2.

Well,\\nit may sound trivial but doing so is not always easy. In closing this chapter, we brieﬂy\\nstudy logic and proofs. What is discussed in this section may seem simple and easy in\\nthe beginning, but please don’t be fooled by that. We shall cover some subtle issues that\\nrequire you to think carefully.\\n2.11.1 Statements\\nIn the 2006 FIFA World Cup (WC2006), Australia played Japan in the group stage. I was\\nwatching it on TV with my Australian friends and I was very excited when Japan scored\\nﬁrst in the ﬁrst half. It looked (to me) as if Japan was never going to lose, so I said to my\\nfriends, ‘I think the match won’t ﬁnish with 1-0, the ﬁnal score will be 3-1’. What I meant\\nto say – but didn’t say – was ‘3-1 to Japan’, and my friends seemed to interpret it that\\nway. Well, in the end, to my disappointment, Australia scored three goals in the second\\nhalf and my friends were happy to tell me that ‘3-1, you were right!’.\\n‘Australia defeated Japan in WC2006.’\\nThis is an example of a statement. When a declarative ( objective) sentence can be\\nclassiﬁed as either ‘true’ or ‘false’, but not both, we call it a statement. While the above\\nstatement is indeed true, what about the following?\\n‘This textbook is great!!’\\nIn an everyday conversation, you might call it a statement, but whether you think my\\ntextbook is great is your personal (subjective) opinion. Therefore, in a mathematical sense,\\nit is not regarded as a statement. While I hope the above opinion is popular amongst the\\nreaders, I shall introduce another one.\\n‘10 000 000 000 000 000 001 is a multiple of 7.’\\nDon’t worry if you cannot immediately tell whether it is true or false; perhaps none of\\nus can! But we know that it can not be both true and false. So long as we know that we\\ncan classify it as either ‘true’ or ‘false’, we can call it a statement.\\nSome statements are sometimes true but false other times.

For example, we can\\nnegate a statement P by writing as follows\\n‘not P’ (or ¬P).\\nThis statement is called a negation of the statement P. Trivially, the above negation is\\ntrue when P is false (and is false when P is true).8\\nNow, consider the following statement:\\n‘x2 = 4’.\\nThis statement is true if x =± 2, i.e. x has to be either 2 or −2 for the statement to be\\ntrue. This condition can be denoted by:\\nx = 2\\ued19\\ued18\\ued17\\ued1a\\nP\\nor x =− 2\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17\\ued1a\\nQ\\n. (2.30)\\nIf we let x = 2b e P and x =− 2b e Q, statement (2.30) is called the disjunction\\nof P and Q. For the disjunction ‘ P or Q’ to be true, either P or Q (or both) has to be\\ntrue. In contrast, when we have a statement ‘ P and Q’ we call it the conjunction of\\nP and Q. For the conjunction to be true, both P and Q have to be true. For example,\\nthe conjunction ‘100 < 1 and 100 < 1000’ is false (because ‘100 < 1’ is false) but the\\ndisjunction ‘100 < 1 or 100 < 1000’ is true (because ‘100 < 1000’ is true).\\n2.11.3 Implications\\nSome combinations of statements are particularly important: you will use them frequently\\nin many disciplines that require analytical skills. They are called the implications.A n\\nimplication statement is denoted by:\\nP ⇒ Q,\\nand we read it as ‘P implies Q’ (or ‘Q is implied by P’). For example, consider the\\nfollowing:\\n‘If I am in Tasmania\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nP\\n, then I am in Australia\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nQ\\n’ (2.31)\\nor\\n‘I am in Tasmania\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nP\\n⇒ I am in Australia\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nQ\\n’.\\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\n7 The only team Australia beat in WC2006 was Japan.\\n8 Using the negation twice we obtain P ≡ not(notP).

Suppose P is true, then you are in Tasmania, therefore\\nyou must be in Australia, implying that Q is true. Therefore, statement (2.31) is true. It\\nwould be false if Q were something like, ‘I am in Japan’.\\n2.11.4 Contrapositive and converse\\nIt is known that the implicationP ⇒ Qis logically equivalent to the following implication:\\n‘(notQ) ⇒ (notP)’.\\nIt is called the contrapositive of P ⇒ Q. For example, the contrapositive of state-\\nment (2.31) is:\\n‘If I am not in Australia\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nnot Q\\n, then I am not in Tasmania\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nnot P\\n’. (2.32)\\nThe equivalence between a statement and its contrapositive is a very useful result, which\\nwe shall see in the next section.\\nWe can form another statement by exchanging P and Q in the implication P ⇒ Q,\\nthat is:\\n‘Q ⇒ P’.\\nIt is called the converse of P ⇒ Q. Therefore the converse of statement (2.31) is:\\n‘If I am in Australia\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nQ\\n, then I am in Tasmania\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nP\\n’. (2.33)\\nYou should realise that this statement (2.33) is not necessarily true, although (2.31) is\\ntrue. Indeed, you can be in Australia without being in Tasmania. So...,b ec a r e f u l .W h e n\\nan implication is true, it does not necessarily mean that the converse of it is also true. It\\nprobably sounds quite obvious now that you have read this section, but history tells us\\nthat many students frequently get confused by directions of implications.\\nOf course, for some true implications, their converses may also be true. For example,\\nconsider the following:\\n‘If x = y\\ued19\\n\\ued18\\ued17\\ued1a\\nP\\n, then x − y = 0\\ued19 \\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nQ\\n’. (2.34)\\nStatement (2.34) is a true implication statement. In words, it says that if two numbers\\nare equal, the difference of the two numbers is zero. For this statement, the converse of it\\nis also true:\\n‘If x − y = 0\\ued19\\n\\ued18\\ued17 \\ued1a\\nQ\\n, then x = y\\ued19\\ued18\\ued17\\ued1a\\nP\\n’. (2.35)\\nIn words, it says that if the difference of two numbers is zero, then the two numbers\\nare equal. When both P ⇒ Q and Q ⇒ P occur as above, we write it as P ⇔ Q and\\nread ‘P if and only ifQ’. Some people use the expression ‘ P iff Q’, where ‘iff’ stands\\nfor ‘if and only if’.

For you to\\nbe in Tasmania, you cannot be outside Australia. It is absolutely necessary that you are\\nin Australia. However, your being in Australia is not sufﬁcient for me to conclude that\\nyou are in Tasmania. You might be in Queensland, New South Wales, or in some other\\nstates/territories.\\nFinally, when P ⇔ Q is true, we say that ‘P is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition\\nfor Q’ (or equivalently, we say ‘ Q is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for P’). You\\nshould be able to apply this terminology to explain implications (2.34) and (2.35).\\n2.11.6 Quantiﬁers\\nWe introduce quantiﬁers to close the section in logic. Consider the two following\\nstatements:\\n‘For any real number x, x2 = 9.’\\n‘There exists a real number x such that x2 = 9.’\\nWhilst the former is false, the latter is true. As for the former statement, the word ‘any’\\nimplies that the statement has to be true if we plug in any arbitrarily chosen real number\\nto x. If you choose x to be zero, since 0 ̸= 3, you can see that the statement is false.\\nWhereas for the latter statement, for it to be true, we just have to show the existence of a\\nreal number that satisﬁes x\\n2 = 9. Indeed, both x = 3 and x =− 3 meet the statement.\\nThe former statement involves the use of the universal quantiﬁer ‘for every (or for\\nany)’, and hence the statement encompasses all the real numbers (and this is why the\\nstatement is false: x = 0 is no good, for example). The latter statement, in contrast,\\ninvolves the phrase ‘there exists’, which is called the existential quantiﬁer. This means\\nthat statement is concerned with at least one real number (and this is why the statement is\\ntrue: x = 3 will do).\\nWe can deduce important and strong lessons from the above example. If a statement\\nincludes the universal quantiﬁer, to show that the statement is false, it sufﬁces to produce\\na single counter example (for the statement ‘For any real number x, x\\n2 = 9’, x = 0i s'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

But when a statement includes the existential quantiﬁer,\\nand you want to show that the statement is false, you need to show that every single\\nexample fails to meet the statement (which is obviously more difﬁcult). Mathematicians\\nuse particular notation for these quantiﬁers. Whilst ∀ denotes ‘for every’ ∃ denotes ‘there\\nexists.’ Using them, we can rewrite the previous statements, respectively, as\\n‘∀x ∈ (−∞, ∞),x 2= 9’\\n‘∃x ∈ (−∞, ∞),x 2= 9’.\\nLet me conclude this section by saying that it is important to make a precise statement.\\nA statement ‘ ∃x, x 2=− 9’ reads ‘There exists an x such that x2 =− 9’, but what kind\\nof number is x? If it means a real number, then the statement is false. But if it means a\\ncomplex number, then the statement is true because both x = 3i and x =− 3i meet it.\\nUsually, we are concerned only about the real numbers (or just non-negative numbers) in\\neconomics, and so long as everyone has that common ground, it may be ﬁne to assume\\nthat people will interpret x as a real number. But if you are unsure how things will be\\ninterpreted, you had better specify all the details precisely. Had I said to my friends, ‘the\\nﬁnal score will be 3-1 to Japan’ then they wouldn’t have said to me, ‘you were right!’.\\nInstead, they would have said, ‘you were wrong mate, it was 3-1 to us!’ (but I am sure I\\nwould’ve been equally upset).\\n2.12 Proofs\\nIn this section, we introduce several ways to prove implications. To start with, we will\\ndeﬁne some peculiar types of integers that we will use in our discussion.\\nDeﬁnition 2.1 (Even and odd numbers) An integer n is called an even number if\\nthere is an integer m such that n = 2m. An integer that is not even is called an odd\\ninteger and can be denoted by n = 2m + 1.\\nDeﬁnition 2.2 (Prime number) A natural number m (not including 1) is called a\\nprime number if whenever m can be written as the product m = a · b of two natural\\nnumbers, then a = 1o r b = 1.\\nI think Deﬁnition 2.1 is straightforward to understand, but some readers may have\\ntrouble understanding Deﬁnition 2.2. According to Deﬁnition 2.2, 4 is not a prime number.\\nThis is because 4 can be written as the product 4 = 2 · 2, and for this product, neither\\na = 1 nor b = 1 holds. Notice that ‘whenever’ in the deﬁnition is italicised: 4 can also\\nbe written as the product 4 = 1 · 4, in which case a = 1, but for a number to be a prime\\nnumber, either a = 1o r b = 1 needs to occur whenever the number is written as the\\nproduct a · b. In contrast, 5 is a prime number because the only ways to write it as the\\nproduct are 5 = 1 · 5 and 5 = 5 · 1, and so either a = 1o r b = 1 will occur when 5 is'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

More plainly put, a prime number has no divisors except for 1 and the\\nnumber itself.\\nNow, we go into the main story. Consider the following (implication) statement.\\nLet m be an even integer and p be any integer. Then m · p is an even integer. (2.36)\\nYou think the statement is true (don’t you?), perhaps after trying out some numbers.\\nBut how can you be absolutely sure that it is true? How can you rule out the possibility\\nthat somebody comes to you with a counter example? The only way to be absolutely sure\\nthat you are right is to prove that the statement is true. What do we mean by proving\\n(mathematically) that a particular statement is false (or true)?\\nA proof is a process of deducing an irrefutable conclusion from accepted assumptions.\\nThese assumptions may come from three sources. Firstly, the assumptions may be given\\nspeciﬁcally in the statement of the question. For example, statement (2.36) has two\\nassumptions. One is that m is an even integer and the other is that p is any integer.\\nSometimes these assumptions together with a chain of logic may lead to the conclusion\\nyou want. But when these assumptions are not enough, we need to introduce the second\\ngroup of assumptions. They are assumptions that are generally accepted as true – in\\nmathematics these are called axioms – and we use them without proving that they are\\ntrue. For instance, for any real numbers a, b and c, nobody will refuse accepting the\\nfollowing four properties of equality.\\na = b and b = c ⇒ a = c. (2.37)\\na = b ⇒ a + c = b + c. (2.38)\\na = b ⇒ a · c = b · c. (2.39)\\na = b and c = d ⇒ a · c = b · d. (2.40)\\nThirdly, statements that have been proven previously will be accepted as true by every-\\none, so they can also be used as assumptions when necessary.\\nIn the following, I demonstrate how we can prove statement (2.36) using adirect proof\\n(or the direct method). Subsequently I shall introduce a few other proof methods, which\\nyou will frequently use.\\n2.12.1 Direct method\\nSuppose there are two statements P and Q, and you are sure that P implies Q, but you\\ncannot see immediately how Q necessarily occurs when P occurs. In statement (2.36), P\\nis ‘m is an even integer and p is an integer’ and Q is ‘m · p is an even integer’.\\nOne way to proveP ⇒ Q is to make a detour. You may be able to see thatP necessarily\\nleads toA, that isP ⇒ A. You may also be able to see thatA will causeB,s oA ⇒ B.Y o u\\nare also convinced that Q will occur when B occurs, i.e. B ⇒ Q.

In the\\nﬁrst example, I will show that the converse of Corollary 2.1 is also true (remember that\\nthe converse of a true statement is not necessarily true).

Therefore,\\nm2 = (2n + 1)2 = 4n2 + 4n + 1.\\nThis can be rearranged as:\\nm2 = 2(2n2 + 2n) + 1.\\nSince (2n2 + 2n) is an integer, this implies that m2 is odd (by deﬁnition).\\nBut it contradicts to the assumption (of the lemma itself) that m2 is even.\\nTherefore our initial supposition was incorrect, and we have proven that m is even. ■\\nExercise 2.15 Proof by contradiction.\\nTheorem\\n√\\n2 is an irrational number.\\nProof We again start with negating the conclusion.

This is because when both of them are even, by deﬁnition of even integers, we\\ncan factor 2 out of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction (and keep doing\\nthat until one (or both) of them becomes odd).

For some readers these terms may not sound\\nrelevant to either economics or ﬁnance, but it turns out that they can be powerful in\\nexamining various problems in both economics and ﬁnance. For example, when we\\nbuy a house, a car, or furniture, we may want to borrow money from a bank. Usually\\nborrowing involves a series of repayments and naturally we are interested in the\\nsize of the repayments. How will interest be charged on these repayments? Financial\\ninstitutions often use a procedure that is called daily compounding in calculating\\ninterest payments. By using mathematical techniques we learn in this chapter, it\\nturns out the payments can be calculated in a simple manner. Various other ideas in\\nﬁnance will be introduced in this chapter while we go through some mathematics.\\nChapter goals By studying this chapter you will\\n(1) become familiar with basic mathematical notions used in ﬁnancial mathematics,\\nsuch as limits, summation, geometric series;\\n(2) be able to interpret exponential and logarithmic functions;\\n(3) be able to calculate the net present value of an investment project and make the\\ncorrect decision on whether to invest; and\\n(4) be able to use a time line to visualise an ordinary annuity and express it using the\\ngeometric series.\\n3.1 Limits\\nWe start with considering the following statement:\\nlim\\nx→a\\nf (x) = L. (3.1)\\nEquation (3.1) says that L is the limit of f (x)a s x tends to a, where L and a are both\\nreal numbers. It means that the value of the function f (x) becomes very close to L if x is\\nvery close to a. You might notice thatx can become closer to a either from smaller values\\nor from larger values. The former is called the left-hand limit and the latter is called the\\nright-hand limit, and they are expressed as Equations (3.2) and (3.3), respectively.\\nlim\\nx→a−\\nf (x) = L.

Likewise, Equation (3.3) means that the value\\nof the functionf (x) becomes very close toL if x approaches a from larger values. Let us\\nsee these notions by using some examples.\\nLet us consider the following function:\\nf (x) = x2 + 1. (3.4)\\nWhat is the limit of this function asx approaches 1? It is rather obvious, asf (x)i s\\ndeﬁned at x = 1, i.e. f (1) = 2. It does not matter whetherx becomes closer to 1 from\\nsmaller values or larger values: the value of the function approaches 2. That is:\\nlim\\nx→1−\\nf (x) = lim\\nx→1+\\nf (x) = f (1) = 2. (3.5)\\nWhen the ﬁrst two equalities of Equation (3.5) holds, we call that the functionf (x)i s\\ncontinuous at x = 1. More formally, continuity of a function can be deﬁned as follows.\\nDeﬁnition 3.1 A function f (x) is continuous atx = a, where a is in the domain of\\nf , if the left- and right-hand limits atx = a exist and are equal, i.e.\\nlim\\nx→a\\nf (x) = lim\\nx→a−\\nf (x) = lim\\nx→a+\\nf (x),\\nand the limit asx tends to a equals the value of the function at that point, that is,\\nlim\\nx→a\\nf (x) = f (a).\\nAs we can see in Figure 3.1, the functionf (x) is continuous for allx. Roughly speaking,\\ncontinuous functions are those that can be drawn without removing a pen from paper.\\nNow, let us look at functions that are not continuous.

Let us think\\nhow many years it will take for our money to double at the effective rate of 5 per cent.\\nRecall ﬁrst that the effective rate is the equivalent rate compounded annually.

Recall that if interest is\\ncompounded annually at 5 per cent (the example we saw above) it takes (approximately)\\n14.21 years for our money to double.\\nThis ﬁnding is consistent with our discussion on the compound interest in the previous\\nsection. Given a positive nominal rate, recall that, the more frequent the compounding, the\\ngreater is the compound interest. It follows that, given a positive nominal rate, the more\\nfrequent the compounding, the less time it will take for our money to double.

We have\\nseen that if the savings account pays 10 per cent compounded annually, by the end of the\\nsecond year your account is worth\\n$100 × (1 + 0.1)\\n2 = $121.\\nIt implies that $100 you receive today is worth more than $100 you may receive two years\\nlater.

Hence, by simply applying one of\\nthe power rules, we can conclude that, for the periodic rate of r over n interest periods,\\nfor the compound amount to be S, the principal P that must be invested is given by:\\nP = S(1 + r)−n.

Let us think\\nabout why it is the case. What is your outside option? The only option given in the\\nquestion is to deposit your initial cash outlay at the bank. That is, if you didn’t invest in\\nthis business, you could have earned 7 per cent compound interest for 5 years at the bank.\\nIn other words, by investing in the business, you are forgoing an opportunity of earning\\nthe interest return on your deposit at the bank. We say that there is anopportunity costof\\ninvesting this money in the business, and it is equal to the interest return forgone. When\\nthe nominal rate is 7 per cent, that cost turns out to be too large.\\nIn contrast, in Question B, the investment turns out to be proﬁtable ( NPV > 0). It\\nshows that investing in this business is a cheaper way of producing that income stream\\nthan depositing in the bank. The opportunity cost of investing in this business is forgo-\\ning the interest return from the bank deposit, which is 2 per cent. This is considerably\\nlower than 7 per cent in Question A, and indeed it turns out that the opportunity cost\\nis low enough for you to prefer investing in the business rather than depositing in the\\nbank.\\n3.8 Annuities: what is the value of your home loan?\\nThe major personal ﬁnancial transactions in our lives involve a series of repayments\\nor payments. In ﬁnance, a series of repayments or payments is called an annuity.F o r\\nexample, most people use a loan to purchase their home and then make a series of regular\\nrepayments to pay off this loan.

In this section we will discuss these two types of annuity in\\nturn.\\n3.8.1 Present value of an ordinary annuity\\nConsider the following situation. You decided to use a loan to purchase your home at\\nthe beginning of Period 1. You are now committed to make n times of repayments to\\na bank. Each time, you are repaying R dollars. The repayments will start at the end of\\nPeriod 1, and will occur at the end of each period until the end of Period n. We say that\\nthe term of this annuity is n periods and each of the n periods is called the repayment\\nperiod.\\nWe also assume that compounding takes place at the end of each repayment period.\\nSuch an annuity is called an ordinary annuity. When compounding takes place at the\\nbeginning of each period, it is called an annuity due, but it is not going to be our\\nfocus. Note that when compounding takes place at the end of each repayment period, the\\ncompounding period and the repayment period coincide. In such a case, the annuity is\\ncalled a simple annuity. Whereas when these periods do not coincide – e.g. when you\\nmake annual repayments when interest is compounded continuously – the annuity is called\\na general annuity. We will not deal with general annuities in this book, so our focus in\\nthe following will be ordinary simple annuity.\\nNow suppose the periodic rate is denoted by r. The present value of an annuity\\n(A) is the sum of the present values of all the repayments, which can be written as\\nfollows:\\nA = R(1 + r)\\n−1 + R(1 + r)−2 + R(1 + r)−3 +···+ R(1 + r)−(n−1) + R(1 + r)−n.\\n(3.50)\\nThe use of a time line helps you visualise this equation. In Figure 3.7, a time line\\nis drawn. It describes how all the repayments are discounted to their present values. R\\nrepayed at the end of Period 1 is discounted back one period to R(1 + r)−1, R repayed at\\nthe end of Period 2 is discounted back two periods to R(1 + r)−2, and so on. You can see\\nthat the RHS of Equation (3.50) is merely the collection of them.\\nIt can be observed that the right hand side of Equation (3.50) is the geometric series of\\nn terms with the initial value R(1 + r)−1 and the common ratio (1 + r)−1.

Recall that we dealt withmarket supply\\ncurves in previous chapters. They were generally assumed to be upward sloping (the\\nlaw of supply). In this chapter, we will derive an upward sloping supply scheduleof a\\nﬁrm both intuitively and mathematically. To this end, we will focus on a ﬁrm’s proﬁt\\nmaximisation problem that underlies it.\\nA ﬁrm is an institution that hires factors of production (inputs) and transforms\\nthem into goods and services (outputs) using its production technology. Here we\\nconsider a ﬁrm whose objective is to maximise its proﬁts. Therefore we are interested\\nin obtaining the level of output that maximises the ﬁrm’s proﬁts. In the course of\\nobtaining the proﬁt maximising level of output, we will introduce differentiation,\\nwhich is the process of ﬁnding the derivative of a function, and will also foreshadow\\nsome of the important mathematical notions related to curve sketching that will be\\ncovered in the next chapter.\\nChapter goals By studying this chapter you will\\n(1) be able to explain various notions regarding costs;\\n(2) be able to interpret what it means by differentiating a function; and\\n(3) be able to set up and solve the ﬁrm’s proﬁt maximisation problem.\\n4.1 Cost function\\nAs mentioned before, aﬁrm is an institution that hiresfactors of production (inputs),\\nsuch as labour, machines and raw materials, and transforms them into goods and services\\n(outputs) by using their production technologies. Our focus will be proﬁt maximising\\nﬁrms, i.e. those whose objective is to maximise their proﬁts. Througout this chapter, we\\nwill also limit our analysis to theshort run. A short run is the time period in which at least\\none factor of production is ﬁxed: for example, it is hard to imagine that a new factory is\\nbuilt in a few days. Typically, capital (K) is ﬁxed in the short run. Some other inputs, such\\nas labour and raw materials, can typically be changed in the short run. Here, we assume\\nthat only one input is variable in the short run, which we call labour (L), and also assume\\nthat only one good is produced. In passing, the other time frame economists frequently\\nuse is thelong run, where all factors of production including capital are variable, but this\\ntime period is not of interest to us here.\\nTo ﬁgure out the proﬁts the ﬁrm might make, it has to know (a) how much its products\\nsell for at the market; and (b) how much it needs to pay to hire factor(s) of production.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

In this chapter, we make an assumption on\\nmarkets for both inputs and outputs (unless it is explicitly noted otherwise). Namely, we\\nassume that both the goods market and the labour market are competitive: since there are\\nso many parties involved in both of these markets,no single party has power to change\\nthe price by itself. Under this situation,each party takes the market price as given.M o r e\\nspeciﬁcally, we assume that a ﬁrm sells its product at a product price (p) and hires the\\nlabour it needs at its market price (w per hour).\\nLet q and c denote the amount of the good it produces and thetotal cost, respectively.\\nIn the short run, the total cost consists of two parts: theﬁxed cost (FC) and thevariable\\ncost (VC). The former is the cost of production that does not depend on the quantity of\\nproduction, i.e. the cost a ﬁrm incurs regardless of the production level. The latter is the\\ncost of production that varies with the quantity of production. Therefore:\\nc = FC + VC (q).\\nThe notation VC (q) shows that the variable costVC is a function ofq (it depends on\\nq). Accordingly, the total cost also depends onq, so let us write the above relationship as\\nfollows:\\nc = C(q) = FC + VC (q). (4.1)\\nC(q) is called thecost function: it is a functionC that maps quantity of productionq\\nto the total costc.\\n4.1.1 A numerical example\\nTable 4.1 shows the various costs of a ﬁrm in goods production.

We will prove these facts\\nmathematically later in this chapter, but let us try thinking about them intuitively ﬁrst.\\n4.2.1 Intuitive explanation\\nThe reason for the above relationship regardingMC, AC and AV C can be seen with an\\nanalogy. Imagine that the average age of the students attending a particular class is 20.\\nSuppose one student comes in late and joins the class. Say this student’s age is 19. What\\nwill happen to the average age of the students in this class? Our intuition suggests that the\\naverage age should go down. The logic is simple: this student’s contribution to the total\\nnumber of the age in class is below the average (prior to him joining), so the average age\\nfalls inevitably.\\nSome of you may wonder what the above story has to do with the relationship between\\n‘marginal’ and ‘average’. If so, you need to think what the ‘marginal age’ is in this context\\n(‘the average age’ is rather obvious). Recall that the marginal cost is the change in the\\ntotal costs when there is a one-unit change in the quantity produced. Then, likewise, we\\ncan deﬁne the marginal age as the change in the total age (in the class) whenone student\\njoins the class (i.e. a one-student increase). In the above story, you can see that 19 (the\\nnew student’s age) is the marginal age because the total age of the class has gone up by\\n19 when this student has joined the class.\\nThus, in the above story, the marginal age (which is 19) is less than the average age\\n(prior to him joining the class, which is 20). In this case, the average age of the class goes\\ndown. On the other hand, if the student who joins is 21 instead of 19, then the scenario\\nwill be the opposite. This student’s age of 21 is greater than the class average of 20, and\\nthis above-average contribution by the student increases the average age of the class. In\\nother words, if the marginal age is greater than the average age, then the average age of\\nthe class increases when a student with this age joins.\\n4.3 Production function\\nNow we get to answering the question we asked at the end of Section 4.1: what explains\\nthe shape of the typical cost function? Throughout the discussion here, we call the variable\\ninput labour (L) and the ﬁxed input capital (K). It is obvious from Table 4.1 that the ﬁxed\\ncost is $500, which means that to hire capitalK the ﬁrm has paid $500. It is ﬁxed, so this\\nﬁrm has to pay $500 regardless of how much they produce. To change the level of output\\nin the short run, it can only vary the level of the other input, labour, which costsw per\\nunit. Our interest is to investigate the relationship between the level of output and the level\\nof labour input.\\nNote that this ﬁrm’s labour hiring cost corresponds exactly to its variable cost (VC ),\\nbecause labour is the only input that is variable in the short run. Look at Table 4.4. It is\\nidentical to Table 4.1 except for the ﬁnal column where labour input is shown. Suppose\\nthat it costs $10 to hire one hour of labour (w = 10). Then we can deduce the hours of\\nwork (L) that are needed for each level of production (q). For example, in order to produce\\none unit, the variable cost is $200. It means 20 (200 divided by 10) hours of labour are'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

If the marginal product of labour is increasing, then the marginal cost is\\ndecreasing, and vice versa.\\nIn Section 4.1 we deferred answering the question: what sort of production technology\\nare we looking at? Let us think about the above pattern of the marginal product of labour.\\nFor instance, consider working in a restaurant and, to start with, suppose you are the only\\nworker. As a sole worker, you have to do everything – taking orders, all the cooking,\\nserving, etc. – by yourself, yet still you are able to serve a certain number of customers in\\na day. The marginal product of labour is equivalent to your output (i.e. an increase in the\\nrestaurant’s total output). Now, if the restaurant hires another worker who has the same\\nskills, then you can imagine that the restaurant’s output in a daymore than doubles. Why?\\nThe new worker is as skillful as you are, so if both of you worked independently, then the\\noutput should double. That is, the marginal product of the new worker (an increase in the\\ntotal output caused by the new worker) is the same as yours (i.e. your output when you\\nwere the sole worker). But you and the new worker may be able to do better than working\\nindependently; both of you can coordinate – e.g. one specialises in cooking and the other\\nin all the other things – and work more effectively as a team. In this case, the marginal\\nproduct (let me remind you again, it is an increase in the total output caused by the new\\nworker) is greater than yours (an increase in the total output caused by you when you were\\nthe sole worker, i.e. your output before the new worker joined). A third worker may allow\\nmaking the kitchen (and hence the whole restaurant) work more efﬁciently; two workers\\nmay be able to specialise in particular processes in the kitchen while another worker does\\nall the other things in the dining area. The marginal product of the third worker, in this\\ncase, is greater than that of the second one.\\nY ou may be able to envisage the increasing marginal product described as above up to\\nsome level of output but, as you might already have guessed, there may be an end to it;\\ni.e. the diminishing returns to labour may kick in at some stage. Any restaurant has its\\ncapacity (it presumably depends on the size of the restaurant, which has to do with the\\nﬁxed costs) – both in the kitchen and in the dining area – and so the room for further\\ncoordination between the workers becomes less and less. At some stage, an additional\\nworker may increase the total output (so the marginal product is positive) but this increase\\nin the total output may be less than that when the previous worker was hired. Y ou may\\neven be able to imagine the case under which the marginal product is negative (i.e. the total\\noutput decreases when the new worker is hired), although numbers provided in Table 4.4\\ndo not consider this extreme situation.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

If you encounter other tables that summarise some\\nproduction technology, they maynot necessarily replicate the story described above. For\\nexample, the table may represent the case where the marginal product of a particular input\\nis constant (see Question 2 in Section 4.8).\\n4.4 Firm’s supply curve\\nNow we are in a position to deduce an upward sloping supply curve of a ﬁrm. Checking\\nthe validity of the following claim turns out to be (almost) equivalent to conducting this\\ntask: a ﬁrm in a competitive market (that is, this ﬁrm takes the price as given) will choose\\nthe quantity such that the price equals the marginal cost.\\n1\\nLet us investigate why it is the case using our example. Suppose the price of a good\\nin a competitive market is $210. It means that if a ﬁrm increases the supply by one unit,\\nits revenue increases by $210 (because that one unit will sell for $210 for sure). This\\nextra revenue resulting from producing and selling one more unit is called themarginal\\nrevenue. In a competitive market, the marginal revenue – denoted byMR – is the same\\nas the market price (p).\\nLook at Table 4.5. Suppose you are producing 3 units of output. Should you produce\\nanother unit of output? The answer is YES. Because, by producing and selling another unit\\nof output, you will get $210 of marginal beneﬁt, whereas the marginal cost of producing\\nthat unit is only $120. Y ou will gain $90 by producing another unit. Hence, it is not proﬁt-\\nmaximising to stop producing at 3 units of output. Then, is it proﬁt-maximising for you to\\nstop at producing 4 units of output? The answer is NO. Because, again, by producing and\\nselling another unit of output (the ﬁfth unit), you will get $210 of the marginal revenue,\\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\n1 I will shortly show that the claim is true only when the price is sufﬁciently high; hence there is a word ‘almost’ in\\nthe brackets.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

Suppose you are producing and selling 6 units of\\noutput. Should you produce the seventh unit? The answer is NO. Because by producing\\nand selling that unit, you will obtain the marginal revenue of $210 (the market price), but\\nthe marginal cost of producing that unit is $280. Y ou willlose $70 by producing this unit,\\nso it is better for you to stop at the sixth unit production. The proﬁt-maximising output is\\ntherefore 6 units.\\nWhat the above analysis shows is that a ﬁrm increases quantity of production if the\\nmarginal revenue is above the marginal cost, and it stops doing so whenMR = MC.\\n2\\nHence the correctness of the initial claim is veriﬁed:a ﬁrm in a competitive market will\\nchoose the quantity such that the price equals the marginal cost.\\n4.4.1 Not all parts of the MC curve are the supply curve\\nWe have shown that theMC curve is, in fact, the supply curve of a ﬁrm in a competitive\\nmarket. The supply curve is theMC curve drawn on a space of (p,q ) instead of (MC,q ).\\nHowever, we need to be careful. Only some parts of theMC curve are the supply curve.\\nWe will illustrate it here using Figure 4.4 of this chapter (we relabel it as Figure 4.6).\\nThere are two important points in Figure 4.6.

The\\ntotal revenue is simply the quantity of output sold multiplied by the price per output, so it\\nis $3200.

Using this expression, the ﬁrm’s proﬁts now become\\np · q − AV C· q − FC .\\nRecall that p = AV Cat Point S, so the ﬁrst two terms of the expression for the proﬁts\\ncancel out. It means that the ﬁrm’s proﬁts are exactly the negative of the ﬁxed costs, i.e.\\nthe ﬁrm makes losses exactly equal to $500 if it produces at Point S (which is the best it\\ncan do as long as it wants to produce). These losses are equivalent to the losses this ﬁrm\\nwill make if they choose not to produce. Hence the ﬁrm is indifferent between producing\\nand not producing. The situation can be seen in Figure 4.10. By now you should be able\\nto verify that the (negative) proﬁts are described by the rectangle p\\nSADS.\\nPoint S in Figure 4.10 is called theshutdown pointbecause if the price goes belowpS –\\nthe ﬁnal case – it is better for a ﬁrmnot to produce (shutdown production). Whenp<p S,\\nif a ﬁrm chooses to produce output where p = MC (the best the ﬁrm can do if they want\\nto produce), it makes losses, and the losses are greater than those under zero production.\\nTherefore, the ﬁrm will not supply in the case whenp<p S. You should attempt Question 3\\nin Section 4.8 to verify the claim both algebraically and diagrammatically.\\nIn summary, the MC curve is the supply curve of a ﬁrm in a competitive market, but\\nonly the segment above the shutdown point (the intersection of MC and AV Ccurves) is\\nrelevant. In other words, it is proﬁt maximising for a ﬁrm to supply a quantity such that\\nprice equals the marginal cost if p ≥ pS, but to supply zero if p<p S. A ﬁrm’s supply\\ncurve is hence case-deﬁned.\\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\n3 In economics, if a ﬁrm is indifferent in producing and not producing, it is often assumed that it will produce.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

Our ﬁrst focus is the total cost curve for a ﬁrm.\\nLook at Figure 4.11. Consider that you are producing q0 units of the goods, i.e. our\\nattention is on Point A. Recall that the cost function is written as C(q), so the total\\ncosts for that production level are written as C(q0). Suppose you increase production by\\none unit, and now you are producing q1 units of the goods; obviously q1 = q0 + 1. At\\nthis production level, the total costs are C(q1). The difference between these two costs,\\nC(q1) − C(q0), is the marginal cost when you are producing q0 units of this good. The\\nnext diagram is the enlargement of the cost curve in Figure 4.11. The marginal cost at\\nPoint A is equal to the distance BE.\\nOn Figure 4.12, a straight line DJ is drawn.

We know that themarginal cost (for an inﬁnitesimal change\\nin production) is equal to theslope of this curve, so it means theMC of production varies\\naccording to the levels of production.\\nStep 2.

Do the same for q = q2 and q = ˆq, and say the slopes of the TC curves at these\\nlevels of q are 4 and 1, respectively. Plot these numbers in the bottom diagram.\\nStep 5. Moving from zero production to q = ˆq, we can observe that the slope of the\\ntotal cost curve becomes smaller (ﬂatter and ﬂatter) and becomes the smallest when the\\nproduction level is ˆq. It corresponds to the increasing marginal product of labour. It means\\nthat theMC behaves in the same way, i.e. theMC in the bottom diagram decreases untilˆq.\\nStep 6. From here the slope of the TC curve, i.e. the MC, starts increasing. For example,\\ntake q = q\\n3, q = q4 and q = q5. You can see that the slope of the TC curve becomes\\ngreater as q rises. Say these slopes are 2, 8 and 20, respectively. These numbers are\\nplotted as the marginal costs for q = q3, q = q4 and q = q5, respectively, in the bottom\\ndiagram.

The above steps explain how the seven dot points on the TC curve in the top\\ndiagram correspond to the seven dot points in the lower diagram. For illustrative purposes,\\nonly seven levels of production are taken, but we can consider conducting the same\\noperation for all the levels of q. It will result in the MC curve as in the bottom diagram.\\nWe already know that the MC curve is the supply curve as long as the market price\\nis equal to or above the price of shutdown point. Therefore, in order to ﬁnd a supply\\ncurve for a ﬁrm, we need to do two things if its cost function is given: (a) differentiate the\\ncost function to obtain the MC; and (b) ﬁnd the shutdown point. We will go through the\\nprocess in Section 4.7 but, in the meantime, we shall re-examine the important relationship\\nbetween the MC, AC and AV Ccurves we previously discussed, using differentiation.\\n4.6 The relative positions of MC , AC and AVC revisited\\nWe have already discussed the importance of the relative positions ofMC, AC,a n dAV C\\ncurves.\\n(1) When the marginal cost ( MC) is less than the average total cost (AC), then AC is\\ndeclining.

When MC is greater than AV C, then AV Cis increasing.\\nWe have already given intuitive support for these claims, but can we prove them if we\\nallow q to change by an inﬁnitesimally small amount? In the following we will prove the\\nﬁrst claim using the technique of differentiation. The second one is left as an additional\\nexercise at the end of the chapter (Section 4.8).\\nThe proof of the ﬁrst claim is as follows. Denote the average total cost by AC(q) and,\\nby deﬁnition, it is equal to C(q)\\nq .

That is:\\nC′(q) > C(q)\\nq . (4.12)\\nRearranging this yields:\\nC′(q) · q − C(q) > 0. (4.13)\\nGetting back to Equation (4.11):\\nAC′(q) = C′(q) · q − C(q)\\nq2 . (4.14)\\nGiven Equation (4.13), we know both the numerator and the denominator of the RHS of\\nEquation (4.14) are positive, meaning that the slope of theAC curve, AC′(q), is positive.\\nHence AC is increasing. Recall that we supposed that MC is greater than AC in order to\\nderive this result. Hence, we have shown that, when MC is greater thanAC, then AC is\\nincreasing. When MC is less than AC, you just need to change the direction of inequality\\nand the proof is done.\\nThis claim should imply that when MC and AC are U-shaped, the marginal cost curve\\ncuts the minimum point of the AC curve. In fact, we can demonstrate it. Let us denote q\\nthat corresponds to the minimum ofAC curve by ˆq. When q = ˆq, the slope of AC is zero\\ni.e. AC′( ˆq) = 0. Therefore,\\nC′( ˆq) · ˆq − C( ˆq)\\nˆq2 = 0. (4.15)\\nFor this equation to hold, the numerator of the LHS of (4.15) has to equal zero. It\\nfollows:\\nC′( ˆq) · ˆq − C( ˆq) = 0. (4.16)\\nIn turn, this implies that the following holds at the minimum of AC curve:\\nC′( ˆq) = C( ˆq)\\nˆq . (4.17)\\nLet us investigate Equation (4.17) carefully. The LHS is the marginal cost at ˆq. The\\nRHS is the average cost at ˆq. This means that the marginal cost curve cuts the minimum\\nof the AC curve.\\n4.7 Proﬁt maximisation\\nNow let us show mathematically why the supply curve is identical to a segment of the\\nMC curve. Remember, when we arrived at that conclusion using a numerical example, it\\nwas done by investigating a ﬁrm’s proﬁt maximising behaviour. Hence, we do the same\\nhere: we set up a ﬁrm’s proﬁt maximisation problemin a mathematical fashion.\\nTo begin with, denote a ﬁrm’s proﬁts byπ. Since proﬁts are revenue less total costs:\\nπ = π(q) = p · q − C(q).

Here ourobjective is to maximise the proﬁt func-\\ntion π(q), so π(q) is called the objective function. Y ou write the objective function\\nto the right of ‘max’ so everyone knows what you want to maximise. To maximise the\\nobjective function, what you control (choose) is the level of production q, so the vari-\\nable q is called the control variable or the choice variable. It is important to write the\\ncontrol variable below ‘max’ so people know by which means you are maximising your\\nobjective.\\n4.7.1 Solving the maximisation problem in general\\nFor the time being, let us consider ﬁnding a maximum of a functionin general. We will\\ncome back to maximising the proﬁt function in Section 4.7.4. We will keep using the\\nsame notation, though, to preserve continuity in our discussion. Our problem here is to\\nmaximise a functionπ(q) by choosing the level ofq (but q and π(q) are not really related\\nto quantity and proﬁts, respectively).\\nLet us start by describing the functionπ(q) diagrammatically, takingq on the horizontal\\naxis andπ(q) on the vertical axis.If it has the shape illustrated as in Figure 4.15, the level\\nof q that maximises the functionπ(q) is obviouslyq\\n∗.\\nNotice that at PointA, the tangent line to the functionπ(q) has the slope ofzero.

Similarly,\\nthe second derivativeπ′′(q) shows thechange in the slopewhen there is an inﬁnitesimally\\nsmall change inq. To visualise it, look at Figure 4.17.\\nWe can see that theslope of the function in Figure 4.17 is increasing (note the following\\ndifference: as q increases the function π(q) itself ﬁrst decreases then starts increasing,\\nbut the slope of π(q) is increasing throughout). In other words, thechange in the slopeis\\nalways positive for the function in Figure 4.17. As noted, the second derivative shows the\\nchange in the slope, so it meansπ′′(q) > 0. In such a case, we are looking at the bottom\\nof the valley, which we do not want to be doing in ﬁnding theq that maximises π(q).\\nWe can tell the exact opposite story. Look at Figure 4.18. We can see that theslope of\\nthe function is decreasing (again note the following difference: asq increases the function\\nπ(q) itself ﬁrst increases then starts decreasing, but the slope of π(q) is decreasing\\nthroughout). In other words, thechange in the slopeis always negative for the function\\nin Figure 4.18, which impliesπ′′(q) < 0.

Points A and C (top of the hill) are called the\\nlocal maxima. Point B (bottom of the valley) is called the local minimum. The reason\\nwhy we use ‘local’ is because it may be true only locally. That is, the point may not be the\\nmaximum or minimum of the entire curve (function). It is true that Point C is a top of a\\nhill. If you look at qs that are close to Point C – in the neighbourhood of the point – there\\nare no higher points. However, π(q) takes higher values than that at Point C if you look\\nat qs that are further away from Point C.\\nThe highest point of the entire curve is called the global maximum, which occurs in\\nour example when q = q\\n∗ at Point A. So Point A is both the local and global maximum.\\nThe lowest point on the entire curve is called the global minimum. There is no global\\nminimum in this example (why?).\\n4.7.3 Some exceptions\\nIf the function is differentiable everywhere, setting the ﬁrst derivative equal to zero usually\\ngives us either local maxima or local minima. However, there are exceptions. For example,\\nconsider π(q) = q\\n3. The ﬁrst derivative isπ′(q) = 3q2. This is zero only whenq = 0. But\\nit turns out that q = 0 is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum (see Figure 4.20).\\nWe shall learn the nature of such a point – point of inﬂection – in the next chapter, but\\nthe lesson for the time being is that when we use the ﬁrst-order condition (setting the\\nﬁrst derivative equal to zero), we do not necessarily obtain a local maximum or a local\\nminimum. Note, the second derivative is f\\n′′(x) = 6x and when x = 0, f ′′(0) = 0. So,\\nwhen the second derivative is zeroat some point, look out; a function may not take either\\na local maximum or a local minimum at that point.8\\nThe ﬁrst-order condition may not be powerful in the case we refer to as the corner\\nsolution.

It is related to thederivative of the function, so we start with it. For\\nthe cost function C(q), the deﬁnition of the derivative is given in Equation (4.3):\\nC′(q) = lim\\nh→0\\nC(q + h) − C(q)\\nh . (5.1)\\nWe know that it shows the slope of the functionC(q). Now, use /Delta1qinstead of h in the\\nabove deﬁnition. Recall that /Delta1is used to show a change in a variable, so /Delta1qmeans ‘a\\nchange in q’:\\nC′(q) = lim\\n/Delta1q→0\\nC(q + /Delta1q) − C(q)\\n/Delta1q . (5.2)\\nThe numerator of the RHS of this equation is a change in the function C(q) when q\\nchanges by /Delta1q. So let us denote this by using /Delta1as /Delta1C(q). Now the deﬁnition of the\\nderivative becomes:\\nC′(q) = lim\\n/Delta1q→0\\n/Delta1C(q)\\n/Delta1q. (5.3)\\nThe German mathematician Leibniz used the notation dC(q)\\ndq to express the limit of\\n/Delta1C(q)\\n/Delta1qwhen /Delta1q→ 0.

The tangent line at this point, DJ , has a slope of C′(q0). The distance AE is /Delta1q.\\nTherefore, the distance DE can be obtained by multiplying them: DE = C′(q0)/Delta1q. The\\nresidual distance BD is denoted by a Greek symbol,ε (epsilon). So /Delta1C= C′(q0)/Delta1q+ ε.\\nHere is the new idea:C′(q0)/Delta1qis called thedifferential of the functionC(q)a t q = q0,\\nand it is denoted by dC. It is the distance DE in the diagram. It follows that:\\ndC = C′(q0)/Delta1q. (5.6)\\nNote that ε and C′(q0)/Delta1q(= dC) both become smaller as /Delta1qbecomes smaller, butthe\\nformer becomes smaller at a faster rate . To put it another way, when /Delta1qbecomes very\\ntiny, ε becomes negligible and hence/Delta1C≈ C′(q0)/Delta1q= dC. In terms of economics, this\\nmeans that the change in the total costs /Delta1Ccan be approximated by the differential dC\\nat Point A if a change in quantity is very tiny.

In this section, we focus on an economic notion called\\nelasticity. Differentiation turns out to be a powerful tool in examining elasticity as well.\\n5.3.1 What is elasticity?\\nElasticity is a notion that shows the responsiveness of a variable to a change in another\\nvariable. Our focus here is the responsiveness of demand. Demand for a certain good\\nappears to respond to three variables in particular.\\nOne is obviously the product’s own price. The law of demand tells us that if the own\\nprice of the product increases (decreases), demand for that product decreases (increases,\\nrespectively). How responsive is demand to a change in the own price? We measure the\\nresponsiveness by the own price elasticity of demand. Before examining the own price\\nelasticity of demand, though, let us brieﬂy discuss other variables to which demand may\\nrespond.\\nDemand may respond to a change in the prices of other goods. An increase in the\\nprice of Head tennis racquets may increase demand for Babolat tennis racquets, whilst an\\nincrease in the price of tennis balls and tennis courts may decrease demand for Babolat\\ntennis racquets. Head racquets are called the substitutes to Babolat racquets, whereas\\ntennis balls and tennis courts are called complements to Babolat racquets. It is difﬁcult\\nto imagine that a change in the price of a stapler inﬂuences demand for Babolat racquets:\\na stapler neither substitutes nor complements Babolat racquets. The responsiveness of\\ndemand for a good to a change in the price of another good is measured by thecross price\\nelasticity of demand.\\nDemand is likely to respond to a change in income. If an increase in income leads to an\\nincrease in demand for goods, these goods are called normal goods. On the other hand,\\nif an increase in income causes a decrease in demand for goods, these goods are called\\ninferior goods. The responsiveness of demand to a change in income is measured by the\\nincome elasticity of demand.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

It shows how responsive demand is to a change in the own price.\\nWe usually use a Greek letter η (read eta) for elasticity. The deﬁnition of it is as follows:\\nη =\\n⏐⏐⏐\\n⏐\\nproportional change in quantity demanded\\nproportional change in the price\\n⏐⏐⏐\\n⏐. (5.10)\\nIt is deﬁned as the absolute value of a ratio of proportional changes in quantity\\ndemanded and the price. There are two important things to recognise: (1) we take the\\nabsolute value; and (2) we take proportional changes (not just changes) in the price and\\nquantity. Why do we do these? Let us discuss the latter ﬁrst; the former will be explained\\nlater when we actually calculate the elasticity.\\nWhy do we take proportional changes to describe the responsiveness ? The reason\\nbecomes clear if you think about the following situation. Think about two people: Kris\\nwho has 30 cups of coffee a month, and Scott who only takes only one cup of coffee a\\nmonth. Suppose the price of coffee has decreased by a little and, as a result, Kris and Scott\\nhave both increased demand for coffee by one cup: Kris takes 31 cups and Scott takes\\ntwo. Should we say that both people’s demands are equally responsive to the change in\\nprice because they both increased demand for coffee by one cup? NO: because for Kris,\\nwho has been drinking 30 cups a month, a one-cup increase in coffee is almost nothing,\\nwhilst for Scott who has been having only one cup a month, drinking another cup implies\\ndoubling the amount of caffeine ingestion. For the same price change, Scott has responded\\nmuch strongly. The above example shows that it is better to use the proportional change\\nin quantity demanded in order to measure the responsiveness. For the price change, we\\ncan tell a similar story.\\n5.3.2 Elasticity is unit-free\\nSince we deﬁne elasticity by the ratio of the proportional changes, it does not matter which\\nunits we use in measuring the price or quantity: this property is called ‘unit-free’. It can\\nbe seen clearly by using an example. Think about two people: Kris who eats 6(kg) of rice\\na month, and Scott who eats 6000(g) of rice a month (note that they eat equal amounts of\\nrice). Owing to a decrease in the price of rice, Kris and Scott now eat 9(kg) and 9000(g)\\nof rice, respectively. The change in demand for rice is 3 for Kris and 3000 for Scott.These\\nchanges are the same in the reality, but the numbers are different according to the units\\nwe use (kilograms or grams). This means that comparing changes in demand for different\\ngoods is difﬁcult because different units are used to count them.\\nHowever, when we calculate the proportional change in the above example, for Kris it\\nis 0.5\\n⎞3\\n6\\n⎠\\nand for Scott it is 0.5\\n⎞3000\\n6000\\n⎠\\nas well. In comparing proportional changes, the\\nunits we use do not matter. This is same for prices. Comparing changes in the prices across\\ncountries is difﬁcult for an obvious reason: currency units are different across countries.\\nBut if we take the proportional changes, we need not worry about units. We can compare\\nthe price elasticity of demand across various people, goods, and countries.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

(5.11)\\nWe denote the current price and quantity byp0 and q0, respectively. Let us also denote\\nvery tiny changes in the price and quantity by the differentials dp and dq. Proportional\\nchanges in the price and quantity can then be described as dp\\np0\\nand dq\\nq0\\n. Hence:\\nηq0,p0 =\\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\\n⏐\\ndq\\nq0\\ndp\\np0\\n⏐\\n⏐⏐⏐\\n⏐. (5.12)\\nNote that elasticity will be different according to the current price and quantity. So we\\nwill put a subscript on η to show at which price and quantity we are evaluating elasticity.\\nLet us rearrange Equation (5.12). Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by\\np\\n0q0. Then it becomes:\\nηq0,p0 =\\n⏐⏐⏐\\n⏐\\ndq\\ndp\\np0\\nq0\\n⏐⏐⏐\\n⏐. (5.13)\\nSo, in order to obtain the price elasticity of demand, we need two pieces of information.\\nOne is the current price and quantity (p\\n0 and q0). The other is dq\\ndp, which is the ratio of two\\ndifferentials. We know that this ratio is equal to the differential coefﬁcientq′(p0) because\\n‘very tiny changes’ are the focus.\\nSuppose Shane’s demand for coffee is given by the following function:\\nq = 5 − 1\\n2q. (5.14)\\nThe ﬁrst thing to note is that the differential coefﬁcient q′(p0) is the same for all p:\\nq′(p) = dq\\ndp =− 1\\n2. (5.15)\\nIt does not depend on the value of p. It is because we have assumed a linear demand\\nfunction, as in Equation (5.14).

It is simple:\\nbecause the differential coefﬁcient is generally negative (the law of demand), and the price\\nand quantity are always non-negative, we need to take the absolute to obtain a non-negative\\nnumber that explains responsiveness of demand.\\n2\\nHere is some terminology you need to remember. In Case A, elasticity is less than unity.\\nAt such a point where a proportional change in the price exceeds a proportional change\\nin demand, we say that demand isinelastic to a change in the price. In contrast, in Case\\nB, elasticity is greater than unity. At such a point where a proportional change in demand\\nexceeds a proportional change in the price, we say that demand iselastic to a change in\\nthe price. When the proportional changes are identical, i.e. when elasticity equals unity,\\nwe call that demand isunitary elasticto a change in the price (at which price and quantity\\nwill it occur?).\\nFigure 5.11 describes the above example. PointsA and B correspond to Cases A and B,\\nrespectively. As we can see,elasticity is generally not constant along the demand curve.\\nHence, in general, wecannot describe the responsiveness of demand as in the following\\nstatement: ‘This demand curve is elastic (inelastic)’. This is a typical misunderstanding\\na number of students have. Instead, we should say, ‘At Point B (A), demand is elastic\\n(inelastic, respectively)’. We need to specify the point of our focus because elasticity\\nchanges from a point to another in general.\\n3\\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• •\\n2 As you may have noticed, taking the absolute value in calculating elasticity has no conceptual merit (it is merely a\\nmeans of obtaining a non-negative number). Indeed, it is usually only at an introductory level of economics that\\nwe take the absolute value and, from the intermediate level onwards, the price elasticity is usually left as a\\nnegative number.\\n3 There exist demands whose own price elasticity is constant at all points; we shall see those shortly. There also\\nexist demands whose own price elasticity changes along the curve but are elastic (inelastic) at all points.

For unitary elastic demand, Area (4) should\\nequal Area (1) asη = 1.

When the price rises, if the\\nquantity demanded stayed the same, total expenditure would unambiguously increase.\\nIn reality, for a downward sloping demand schedule, the quantity demanded decreases,\\nbut an increase in the price has an effect in increasing total expenditure (for the quantity\\nsold): let us call it the ‘price effect’.

We set up the proﬁt\\nmaximisation problem for a ﬁrm in a competitive market, and derived its supply\\nfunction. In doing so, we obtained the ﬁrst- and second-order conditions, which\\ninvolved obtaining the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the proﬁt function, respectively.\\nIn turn, this chapter deals with the consumer’s problem. Similar mathematical\\ntechniques to those we used in examining the ﬁrm’s proﬁt maximisation problem will\\nbe introduced. The main difference is that, here, we will control two variables instead\\nof one. Recall that, in the ﬁrm’s maximisation problem, the quantity produced (q)i s\\nthe only variable that the ﬁrm could control, and hence it required differentiating\\nthe proﬁt function with respect to one variable (q). In this chapter, we deal with\\ntwo goods on which a consumer can spend his/her limited income. How should the\\nconsumer allocate his/her income to the consumption of each of the goods?\\nOur fundamental assumption about consumers’ behaviour is that they choose a\\ncombination of goods they consume so as to maximise their satisfaction. We express\\nthe degree of satisfaction by using the term ‘utility’, whose unit of measurement\\nis a ‘util’. We consider a consumer who makes a decision on how much of which\\ngoods he/she consumes so as to maximise his/her utility. Our main objective in this\\nchapter is to ﬁnd the bundle of goods that maximises a consumer’s utility, when\\nhe/she has a limited amount of income. This problem is known as the constrained\\noptimisation, because he/she faces a constraint in maximising his/her utility. In this\\nparticular problem, the constraint is called the budget constraint. We will ﬁrst discuss\\na simpler version of this problem, the unconstrained optimisation with two variables,\\nand discuss how we can ﬁnd the local maximum and the local minimum. Then, three\\nmethods of solving the consumer’s utility maximisation problem will be explained.\\nThe method that has no particular name will be covered ﬁrst, because it contains a\\nlot of economic intuition and because it is diagrammatically appealing. The second\\nmethod is called the substitution method, and you will see that our problem will be\\nreduced to the single-variate problem we studied in Chapter 4. The third method is\\nfrequently used in various economic applications and is called the Lagrange multiplier\\nmethod. Unsurprisingly, these methods yield the same result.\\nChapter goals By studying this chapter you will\\n(1) be able to partially differentiate the utility function to calculate the marginal utility\\nof a particular good;\\n(2) be able to visualise how the utility function relates to indifference curves as well as\\nmarginal utilities;'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

Consider a good that is beneﬁcial for you (goods that are bad\\nfor you – for example, pollution – are sometimes called ‘bads’ in economics, in passing).\\nIn this case, the more you consume that good, the more utility (satisfaction) you obtain. In\\neconomics, theutility function is used to show the degree of satisfaction a person obtains\\nfrom consuming a bundle of goods. The utility function shows numerical values of utility\\na person obtains by consuming a bundle of goods.\\nLet us draw the utility function. We have the level of utility (u) on the vertical axis and\\nquantity of the good (x) on the horizontal axis. The more you consume, the higher the\\nutility, so the curve is upward sloping. Note that we are just abstracting from the reality and\\ndiscussing levels of consumption that are relevant. For many goods, if you consume too\\nmuch (having 100 pints of beer), your utility may start decreasing, but we don’t consider\\nthe levels of consumption as such. In any case, the utility functionu = U(x) is illustrated\\nin Figure 6.1.\\nOn the diagram in the ﬁgure, a person consumes 9 units of the good (at Point A).\\nThe graph indicates that the level of utility he/she obtains from that consumption is 3\\n(utils).

It is the same argument as in Chapter 4 where\\nwe discussed the cost function and the marginal cost. The slope of the utility function is\\nobtained by taking the ﬁrst derivative of the utility function, which isU\\n′(x). The function\\nis always upward sloping, soU′(x) > 0 for allx> 0.\\nLook at the diagram. I have deliberately drawn the graph so that the marginal utility\\ndecreases as quantity consumed increases. It means that the previous unit of consumption\\ngives you larger satisfaction than the current unit. Imagine that you very much want to\\ndrink beer. The ﬁrst pint is precious, and you appreciate it a lot. Y ou may appreciate\\nthe second pint, but perhaps not as much as the ﬁrst one. The third pint still gives you\\nsome satisfaction because you like beer, but not as much as the previous pint. This pattern\\ndisplayed by the marginal utility is called thelaw of diminishing marginal utility.\\nMathematically, the law of diminishing marginal utility simply implies that the slope\\nof the utility functionU\\n′(x) decreases asx increases. It means that the second derivative\\nU′′(x) is negative for allx> 0. In turn,U′′(x) < 0 implies that the utility functionU(x)\\nis strictly concave. Y ou can see this because any secant line of the utility function lies\\nunder the curve.

The bundle this consumer chooses will be denoted by a combination of the two\\ngoods, (x1,x 2).\\nWe know that an individual consumes either zero or a positive amount of each good. That\\nis, x1 ≥ 0 and x2 ≥ 0. It implies that all the possible combinations of the two goods can be\\ndescribed on the ﬁrst quadrant (including the points on the adjacent axes) of the coordinate\\nplane, where x\\n1 and x2 are taken on the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively.\\nIn Figure 6.2, three consumption bundles are indicated (Points A, B and C). For\\nexample, on Point A, this person consumes 3 units of Good 1 and 2 units of Good 2.\\nFor all the possible consumption bundles, a person is supposed to have ‘taste’. For\\ninstance, if both goods give positive utility (i.e. if they are not the ‘bads’), this person\\nwill rank Point B ahead of Point A (why?). However, for this person, the choice between\\nPoint A and Point C is rather difﬁcult. On Point A this person consumes more units of\\nGood 1 than on Point C, but on Point C he/she consumes more units of Good 2 than on\\nPoint A. We will assume that this person can rank these two bundles, i.e. can tell which\\none is better (or can tell they are equally desirable). The ranking is really up to this\\nconsumer’s taste over the two goods.\\nThe taste over the consumption of the goods is calledpreferences in economics. In the\\nfollowing, we show that a person’s preferences can be represented by the utility function.\\nIf we denote a bundle of goods and utility by ( x\\n1,x 2) and u, respectively, the utility\\nfunction is written as follows:\\nu = U(x1,x 2). (6.1)\\nThis function simply means that utility that a person obtains depends on the amounts of\\nGood 1 and Good 2 that he/she consumes.

Now let us look for other consumption bundles\\nthat might give the same utility level ¯u.\\nSuppose consumption of both Good 1 and Good 2 provides a person with positive\\nutility. It means that if consumption on Good 1 falls, to keep the utility level constant at\\n¯u, consumption on Good 2 has to rise. Likewise, even if consumption on Good 2 falls,\\nif consumption on Good 1 rises by some appropriate amount, a person can keep his/her\\nutility level constant at¯u. Therefore, the set of consumption bundles that provides a person\\nwith the utility level ¯u will be expressed as a downward sloping curve ¯I that cuts Point A,\\n( ¯x\\n1, ¯x2), as in Figure 6.3.\\nAll the consumption bundles on Curve ¯I give the same utility level ¯u to the consumer,\\nand hence for this consumer all the points on Curve ¯I are indifferent. For this reason,\\nCurve ¯I is called the indifference curve.\\nAn indeﬁnite number of indifference curves exists. For example, Curve ˜I illustrated in\\nFigure 6.3 gives the same utility as the consumption bundle ( ˜x1, ˜x2) at Point B.W eh a v e\\npostulated that consumption of both Good 1 and Good 2 provides a person with positive\\nutility. Under this assumption, an indifference curve that lies further to the top-right than\\nanother corresponds to the higher level of utility. A diagram that illustrates a collection of\\nindifference curves is called an indifference map.\\n6.3 The marginal utility for the two-good case\\nWe have discussed the marginal utility for the one-good case. For the two-good case, it is\\nnot as simple. We are looking at two goods now, and there is an important thing for you\\nto remember for the rest of the discussion. When we talk about the marginal utility of one\\ngood, we keep the level of consumption of the other good intact.\\nLet us again consider the situation where a consumer is choosing a particular consump-\\ntion bundle ( ¯x\\n1, ¯x2) and is obtaining utility ¯u.

However, Equation (6.11) (or (6.12)) will not generally hold. That is, the\\nratio of the differentials,du and dx1, and the partial derivativeU1 are different, with some\\nexceptions.

What are the procedures if the function is\\nbi-variate? Recalling that we used the ﬁrst and second derivatives in Chapter 4, some of\\nyou may think about using the ﬁrst- and second-order partial derivatives in the same way.\\nIt’s great if you think like that, but the problem turns out to be much more complicated.\\nForget about the utility maximisation problem for a while, and consider ﬁnding the\\nmaximum/minimum of a general function, f (x\\n1,x 2). This problem is referred to as the\\nunconstrained optimisation problem because you can choose any (x1,x 2) to max-\\nimise/minimise the function; that is, you are not constrained to choose from particular\\ncombinations of (x\\n1,x 2). In contrast, in the utility maximisation problem, which we come\\nback to later, you can’t choose any ( x1,x 2) because you have a limited budget. For now,\\nhowever, you are allowed to choose any combination of (x1,x 2).\\nLook at Figure 6.10. As you can see, the maximum of the function is achieved at\\nPoint A, and ( x∗\\n1 ,x ∗\\n2 ) is the optimal combination of x1 and x2. Let us think about the\\nmathematical properties at Point A. What has to be true at Point A?\\nFirstly, it has to be the case that if we draw a plane (the shaded parallelogram) that\\nis tangent to the function, it has to be parallel to the ( x1,x 2) plane (also shaded). This\\nis analogous to the single-variable case where we could draw a horizontal line at the\\nmaximum. In the mathematics context, it means the following.\\nAllow x\\n1 and x2 to move simultaneously by an inﬁnitesimally small amount from Point\\nA (both directions as the arrows suggest on the diagram).

As in the one-variable case, we\\ncan ﬁnd the exact opposite case, where we ﬁnd the local minimum of a function by using\\nthe same condition. That situation is depicted in Figure 6.11, where Point B is the local\\nminimum of the function.\\nIn any case, we ﬁnd one of the conditions for the local maximum/minimum of a\\nbi-variate function:\\n∂f(x\\n1,x 2)\\n∂x1\\n= ∂f(x1,x 2)\\n∂x2\\n= 0. (6.28)\\nAt the local maximum/minimum, the above set of equations has to hold. It constitutes\\nthe ﬁrst-order conditions for the local maximum/minimum.

Since there are two inputs the ﬁrm\\nwant to choose the optimal K and L, not just the output, q. In the case where K does\\nnot exist (as in Chapter 4), controlling L meant the same as controlling q. But here, the\\nﬁrm can control K as well as L, and different combinations of K and L might result in\\nproducing the same amount of q. In that case, the ﬁrm would want to choose the most\\nefﬁcient combination of K and L to produce that amount. Hence, we consider the ﬁrm\\nthat tries maximising the proﬁts by choosing the amount of both robots ( K) and labour\\n(L).

First, we take an intuitive approach and discuss what should be true,\\nand then we apply different methods to solving the same problem. Unsurprisingly, these\\nmethods give the same result.\\nLook at Figure 6.14. The budget line is given by DD\\n′. Which point on the budget\\nline will the consumer choose? Consider Point B. At Point B, the budget line and the\\nindifference curveintersect. It is on the budget line, but will not maximise the consumer’s\\nutility. Why? Because there exists PointA, which is also on the budget line, and is on the\\nindifference curve that corresponds to a higher level of utility (it is just a diagrammatical\\nexplanation; we will provide an economic explanation shortly).\\nAt PointA, the indifference curve istangent to the budget line. Does any point exist on\\nthe budget line that gives higher utility to the consumer than this point? No, there doesn’t.\\nPoint C is on the indifference curve that gives higher utility than PointA, but is outside\\nthe budget line: such points are infeasible. Therefore, this consumer will choose the utility\\nmaximising bundle (x\\n∗\\n1 ,x ∗\\n2 ) at PointA.\\nWe have checked that the consumer chooses the point where the indifference curve is\\ntangent to the budget line. We know that the absolute value of the slope of the budget\\nline is p1\\np2\\n. We also know that the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve\\nis the marginal rate of substitution MRS12. Therefore, the consumer chooses the point\\nwhere:\\nMRS12 = p1\\np2\\n.

(6.47)\\nWhat is the economic intuition behind this equation? Let us call Good 1 and Good 2\\nhamburger and meat pie, respectively. Suppose that the price per hamburger and the price\\nper meat pie are the same at $2, so the price ratio is 1. Look at Point B on the diagram\\nin Figure 6.14. At this point, MRS\\n12 is greater than 1 (the slope of indifference curve is\\nsteeper), say 2. It means that for the consumer, one hamburger is valued equivalent to two\\nmeat pies. Put it another way, the consumer’s utility will be unchanged if he/she gives up\\ntwo meat pies and obtains one hamburger. There is an opportunity for this consumer to\\nget higher utility: this consumer can sell two meat pies and obtain $4; use $2 out of $4 to\\nbuy one hamburger, which will maintain the original level of utility; and he/she still has\\n$2 in his/her pocket (this $2 can be used to buy either a hamburger or a meat pie, which\\nmakes this consumer’s utility higher than the original level).\\nAs shown above, if the marginal rate of substitution is different from the price ratio\\n(e.g. at Point B), the consumer can always ﬁnd another bundle of goods that gives him/her\\nthe higher level of utility. If the consumer is maximising his/her utility, it has to be the\\ncase that Equation (6.46) holds.\\nBefore you are persuaded by the argument, don’t forget the following. The above\\nargument is valid only if the indifference curves are strictly convex to the origin. It\\nmeans that the indifference curve (1) is always downward sloping; and (2) is strictly\\nconvex. In other words, we can use this method only if the law of diminishing marginal\\nrate of substitution holds. Figure 6.15 illustrates the situation where the marginal rate\\nof substitution is increasing (so the indifference curves are strictly concave towards the\\norigin). In this is the case, ﬁnding the bundle that satisﬁes Equation (6.46) does not lead the\\nconsumer to maximise his/her utility. In Figure 6.15, PointA corresponds to that point, but\\nit is obvious that Bundle B corresponds to higher utility. Since BundleB is on the budget\\nline, we showed that Point A is not optimal (in fact, it will minimise this consumer’s\\nutility).

That is:\\ng(x\\n1,x 2) = 2x1 + x2 − 12 = 0.

Because the price of Good 2 is equal to unity, (the absolute value of) the slope\\nof the budget line represents the price of Good 1, p1. The consumer chooses Point A′ to\\nmaximise his/her utility and the quantity ofx1 demanded is hence x∗ = 3. When the price\\nof Good 1 goes down top1 = 1, then the budget line pivots around PointD to the right to\\nDE. Now the slope of the budget line is equal to unity, and the utility maximising bundle\\nis Point B′ where x∗ = 4. In contrast, the budget line pivots around Point D to the left to\\nDF when the price of Good 1 goes up to p1 = 3. The corresponding quantity of Good 1\\ndemanded at this price is x∗ = 2 (Point C′).\\nLikewise, if you pivot the budget line around Point D (meaning you are changing p1,\\nbut holding both p2 and M constant), you can ﬁgure out the quantity of Good 1 this\\nconsumer will demand for each and every p1 > 0 (other than those we already looked\\nat), given p2 = 1 and M = 12. The graph of x1(p1) is the collection of the ( p1,x (p1))\\nobtained through this procedure.\\nNow consider another exercise: how will the individual demand function for Good 1\\nchange if the consumer’s income is M = 24? The utility maximisation problem for this\\nconsumer when M = 24 is expressed as:\\nMax\\nx1,x2\\nU(x1,x 2)\\ns.t.p 1x1 + x2 = 24,\\n(6.71)\\nwhere U(x) = x\\n1\\n2\\n1 x\\n1\\n2\\n2 .\\nAgain I will leave this problem for you to solve, but you should ﬁnd the solution to be:\\nˆx1(p1) = 12\\np1\\n. (6.72)\\nIn the bottom diagram of Figure 6.16, ˆx1(p1) is illustrated as a dashed schedule. You\\ncan see that the individual demand schedule for Good 1 has shifted to the right when\\nthe consumer’s income has risen. In other words, the quantity of Good 1 demanded\\nby this consumer is greater for each and every price of Good 1 when he/she has more\\nincome. Check that this exercise conforms to the comparative static analysis we studied\\nin Section 2.10.\\nNow we are almost done with uncovering what is behind the demand and supply\\nanalysis. In this chapter, we have derived the individual demand function by solving\\na consumer’s utility maximisation problem. Recall also that in Chapter 4 we derived\\nthe individual ﬁrm’s supply function by solving its proﬁt maximisation problem. The\\n(market) demand function we used in Section 2.10 as well as in Chapter 1 can be obtained\\nby aggregating all the consumers’ individual demand functions. Likewise, the (market)\\nsupply function is the sum of all the ﬁrms’ supply functions. One of the topics we will\\ncover in the next chapter is the aggregation of these individual schedules.\\nIn any case, hopefully by now you realise that the demand and supply schedules\\nwe looked at in Section 2.10 as well as in Chapter 1 did not come from nowhere.

The govern-\\nment levies tax on various goods, and we would like to evaluate how our well-being\\nmight be affected by the taxation. To this end, we ought to discuss a notions called\\nconsumer surplus and producer surplus. They measure consumers’ and producers’\\nwell-being in terms of dollars.\\nAs will become clear in the following sections, measuring consumer surplus or\\nproducer surplus involves calculating the area in between the demand and supply\\nschedules. As long as both curves are linear, there is no problem because we all know\\nhow to calculate the area of a triangle. However, if one (or both) of the demand\\nand supply schedules is (are) non-linear, we need to introduce a certain mathematical\\ntechnique that allows us to calculate the area in question. This technique is called\\nintegral calculus. We begin by studying this technique in the following two sections,\\nwhich will be followed by its application to ﬁnance where I introduce more elaborate\\ntechniques called integration by substitution and integration by parts.\\nWe then discuss the demand and supply analysis from a different point of view.\\nMore speciﬁcally, we will give a different interpretation to the demand and supply\\nschedules we discussed in Chapter 1. It will be the basis of explaining the notion of\\nsurplus. We will also study how to aggregate an individual demand (supply) schedules\\nto obtain the market demand (supply, respectively) schedule. I then demonstrate how\\nwe can incorporate taxation into the demand and supply analysis. It will be shown\\nthat taxation lowers the total surplus in the market. This loss shows the inefﬁciency\\nin the market and is called the deadweight loss of taxation.\\nChapter goals By studying this chapter you will\\n(1) be able to calculate an anti-derivative of a function (where possible);\\n(2) be able to calculate the area of an area under a curve (where possible);\\n(3) be able to explain consumer surplus and producer surplus;\\n(4) be able to carry out demand and supply analysis in the presence of taxation; and\\n(5) be able to integrate demand and supply functions to calculate the deadweight loss\\nof taxation.\\n7.1 An anti-derivative and the indeﬁnite integral\\nConsider a function f (x) = 4x and a function F(x) = 2x2 + 6.

For example, aside\\nfrom F(x) = 2x2 + 6, 2x2 − 4, 2x2 + 100, 2x2, (and so on) are all anti-derivatives of\\nf (x) = 4x (see Figure 7.1).\\nAs we can see, the anti-derivatives of a function differ only by a constant. It is\\nbecause the derivative of any constant is zero. If we denote a constant by C, then all\\nanti-derivatives of 4x can be written as 2 x2 + C (C can be 6, −4, 100, 0, or whatever\\nconstant).\\nTherefore, 2x2 + C is the general representation of anti-derivatives of 4 x. In mathe-\\nmatics, we denote the relationship as follows:\\n∫\\n4xdx = 2x2 + C. (7.1)\\nThe LHS is ‘the indeﬁnite integral of 4x with respect to x’. The symbol\\n∫\\nis called\\nthe integral sign, and 4x and C are called the integrand and the constant of integration,\\nrespectively.

Suppose f (x) is continuous and f (x) ≥ 0 on the interval from\\nx = a to x = b, where a<b as in Figure 7.2.\\nWe denote the area of the region below the function and above the x-axis from x = a\\nto x = b by the following formula:\\n∫b\\na\\nf (x)dx. (7.7)\\nThe above is called the deﬁnite integral (as opposed to the indeﬁnite integral) of f (x)\\non theinterval from x = a to x = b. The numbersa and b are calledlimits of integration,\\nwhere in this casea is thelower limitand b is theupper limit. As in the indeﬁnite integral,\\nf (x) is called the integrand and x is the variable of integration (note that dx is placed\\nafter f (x)).\\nIf f (x) is continuous on the interval fromx = a to x = b and F(x) is any anti-derivative\\nof f (x) on that interval, it is known that the following relationship holds:\\n∫b\\na\\nf (x)dx = F(b) − F(a). (7.8)\\nThis relationship in (7.8) is known as the fundamental theorem of integral calcu-\\nlus.1 To ﬁnd\\n∫b\\na f (x)dx, we need (1) to ﬁnd an anti-derivative of f (x), which is F(x);\\n(2) to ﬁnd F(b) and F(a); and (3) to subtract the latter from the former. If f (x) is non-\\nnegative (f (x) ≥ 0) on the interval from x = a to x = b, by following these three steps,\\nwe can obtain the area of the region below the function and above the x-axis from x = a\\nto x = b.\\nUsually, F(b) − F(a) is expressed by the notation [F(x)]b\\na.

One of the notions we\\nstudied is an ordinary annuity. An ordinary annuity is regular payments (or repayments)\\nmade at the end of each period. The present value of an annuity is the sum of the present\\nvalues of all the payments (or repayments). We know how to obtain it if the periodic rate\\nr and the amount of each payment R are given.\\nNow, we introduce a special case of this annuity, which is called acontinuous annuity.\\nPayments are now made continuously over the time from t = 0t o t = T . How can we\\ncalculate the present value of this annuity when interest is compounded continuously at a\\nnominal rate r (we did not do this in Chapter 3)?\\nTo see this problem, let us consider a discrete case ﬁrst, and consider there are three peri-\\nods. When the three payments of R dollars are made at the end of each year, and the peri-\\nodic rate is r, then the present value of this annuity is: A = R(1 + r)\\n−1 + R(1 + r)−2 +\\nR(1 + r)−3. Note that A is equal to the area of the shaded region in Figure 7.3.\\nNow think what happens to the area if payments and compounding occur continuously\\nuntil the end of Year 3. In Chapter 3, we have shown that the compound amount R of a\\nprincipal ofP dollars aftert years at a nominal interest rater compounded continuously is:\\nR = Pe rt . (7.13)\\nSolving for P we get:\\nP = Re−rt . (7.14)\\nTherefore, under continuous compounding at a nominal interest rater, the present value\\nP (for the payment R made in t) is given by P = Re−rt . Let us draw this present value\\nfunction in Figure 7.4.\\nNow I think you can guess the region that represents the present value of a continuous\\nannuity. Yes: it is the region under the present value function and above the t-axis on the\\ninterval from 0 to 3, which is shown in Figure 7.5.\\nWe know how to obtain the area of the shaded region. It is equivalent to the deﬁnite\\nintegral of P = Re−rt on the interval from 0 to 3. That is:\\nA =\\n∫3\\n0\\nRe−rt dt.

We have shown that the short-run supply\\nschedule of an individual ﬁrm in a competitive market is identical to its marginal cost\\ncurve (above the shutdown price). The market supply schedule we discussed in Chapter 1\\ncan be obtained by summing up individual ﬁrms’ supply schedules for each and every\\nprice. Adding the individual supplies of the ﬁrms mathematically can be tricky at times,\\nand to see why, let us look at the simplest case where there are two ﬁrms who sell apples in\\nthe competitive market. But remember, although there are only two ﬁrms, we still maintain\\nthe assumption of the competitive market; that is, these two ﬁrms take the price as given\\n(if you are not comfortable with the assumption, then you can consider that there are two\\ngroups of ﬁrms).\\nFirm A ’s supply schedule of applesq\\nA ≥ 0 is given by the following demand function:\\nqA =− 1 + 2p, (7.22)\\nwhere p> 0 is the price of apples.\\nLikewise, Firm B’s supply schedule of applesqB ≥ 0 is:\\nqB =− 6 + 3p. (7.23)\\nShall we add these two supplies and obtain the market supplyq? We obtain\\nq = qA + qB =− 7 + 5p. (7.24)\\nIs this correct? In fact, there’s something wrong going on. . . Look at Figure 7.6, in which\\nthree diagrams are drawn side by side. On the ﬁrst diagram, Firm A ’s supply schedule\\nis depicted. It says that the ﬁrm does not supply any apples if the price is below1\\n2 . The\\nmiddle diagram shows Firm B’s supply schedule, which tells us that it does not supply any\\napple if unless the price is above 2 (it suggests Firm B is employing an inferior production\\ntechnology). In any case, the market supply schedule is depicted on the third diagram. An\\nimportant thing to note ﬁrst is that the aggregate supply of apples for the prices below 2\\nis identical to Firm A ’s individual supply (of course, because Firm B supplies no apples).\\nWhen the price is above 2, then Firm B starts supplying according to Equation (7.23).\\nFor example, when p = 3, Firm A supplies q\\nA = 5 and Firm B supplies qB = 3, and\\nhence the market supply isq = qA + qB = 8 when p = 3.

Given our\\nanalysis using the diagrams, it is now quite obvious that Equation (7.24) does not represent\\nthe market supply schedule because it is a linear function that has no kink.\\nNow let us discuss how we go about obtaining the market supply schedule algebraically.\\nRecall that neither ﬁrm’s supply function is deﬁned ifp< 1\\n2 . That is, both ﬁrms’ supply\\nwill be negative (but it has to be non-negative). What it means is that, ifp< 1\\n2 , neither\\nﬁrm supplies and hence the market supply is zero.\\nIf 1\\n2 ≤ p< 2, the market supply consists of Firm A ’s supply only, which implies:\\nq =− 1 + 2p if 1\\n2 ≤ p< 2. (7.25)\\nIf p ≥ 2, the market supply consists of supplies of both Firms A and B, therefore,\\nq =− 7 + 5p if p ≥ 2.

Namely, starting on the ver-\\ntical axis with a particular price, we go horizontally to the right until we hit the sup-\\nply schedule, and then go downwards to ﬁnd the quantity of the good supplied. Both\\nthe individual and market supply schedules can be read this way. For example, in Fig-\\nure 7.6, when p = 3, Firms A and B supplies q\\nA = 5 and qB = 3, respectively, and\\nthe market supply is q = 8. Some textbooks call it the horizontal interpretation of\\nthe market supply schedule. Indeed, I explained the market supply schedule this way in\\nChapter 1.\\nSome textbooks also emphasise a different way of interpreting the supply schedule,\\nwhich is called thevertical interpretation. For this interpretation, we start with a partic-\\nular quantity supplied (by an individual ﬁrm or by the market), and govertically until we\\nhit the corresponding supply schedule. As discussed many times previously, the short-run\\nsupply schedule of an individual ﬁrm in a competitive market is identical to its marginal\\ncost schedule (above the shutdown price). So the height of the supply schedule represents\\nthe incremental cost of further supplying an inﬁnitesimally small amount of this good.\\nTo put it another way, the height of the supply schedule represents themarginal cost of\\nsupplying the good.\\nLet us look at an example. In the above story of the apple market, the two ﬁrms’\\nsupply schedules and market supply schedules are represented by Equations (7.22), (7.23)\\nand (7.27), respectively. Suppose there is no apple supplied in the market,q = 0. Then\\nthe ﬁrst bit of an apple should be supplied by Firm A who has a lower marginal cost,\\nand the marginal cost of supplying the next apple for Firm A is $1\\n2 . By looking at the\\nthird diagram, you can see that whenq = 0 the cost of supplying the next appleto the\\nmarket is $1\\n2 , because Firm A will be the supplier of it. When the quantity of apples\\nsupplied in the market isq = 8, then both ﬁrms are supplying withqA = 5a n dqB = 3.\\nBy looking at the third diagram, we know that the cost of supplying thenext apple to the\\nmarket is $3, i.e. MC(8) = 3. It is the same as both ﬁrms’ marginal cost whenqA = 5\\nand qB = 3, which shows that either of these two ﬁrms can be the supplier of that next\\napple.\\n7.4.3 Producer surplus\\nGiven the vertical interpretation of the supply schedule, it is straightforward to understand\\nthe surplus that accrues to the suppliers. Figure 7.7 replicates Figure 7.6, except that some\\nregions are shaded and that they are now labelled as marginal cost schedules. Suppose the\\nprice of an apple isp = 3, so q\\nA = 5, qB = 3 and q = 8.\\nNow look at the diagram for Firm A:p = 3 is what Firm A receives per apple sold\\nwhereas the height of Firm A ’s marginal cost schedule shows how much it costs for it\\nto produce another bit of an apple. So the vertical difference between the horizontal line\\np = 3 and the marginal cost schedule can be considered to be thesurplus Firm A makes\\nby selling 5 apples. By the same token, the surplus Firm B makes by selling 3 apples is'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

As discussed before, it is approximately equal to the ﬁrm’s\\nproﬁts, but is different because of the ﬁxed cost. Consider that the price and quantity have\\nchanged to p\\n∗∗ and q∗∗, respectively, and now ﬁrm’s surplus changes to (PS ∗∗), which is\\nexpressed as follows:\\nPS ∗∗ = p∗∗q∗∗ −\\n[\\nC(q∗∗) − C(0)\\n]\\n.

A ﬁrm’s surplus per se does not exactly represent its\\nproﬁts (because of the ﬁxed cost), but the change in the surplus exactly represents the\\nchange in the proﬁts (because the ﬁxed cost cancels out). It is true at the market level. That\\nis, the producer surplus per se does not measure the proﬁts of the ﬁrms’ in the market,\\nbut the change in producer surplus exactly measures the change in the proﬁts the ﬁrms in\\nthe market raise.

Likewise, Consumer B’s demand for applesqB ≥ 0\\nis:\\nqB = 5 − p. (7.33)\\nIf we add the two consumers’ demands for apples horizontally, it gives us the market\\ndemand schedule for apples. Figure 7.10 describes three demand schedules. The ﬁrst two\\nare for Consumer A and Consumer B, respectively, and the third one is the market demand\\nschedule. As you can see, the market demand schedule has a kink at PointK. We already\\ndiscussed how the aggregation of individual schedules can be done algebraically – in the\\ncontext of obtaining the market supply schedule – so I will leave that task for you as an\\nexercise.\\nRecall that we can interpret supply schedules in two different ways. We can interpret\\ndemand schedules in horizontal and vertical ways as well.

Both the individual and market demand schedules can\\nbe interpreted this way. For example, in Figure 7.10, whenp = 3, Consumers A and B\\ndemand q\\nA = 7 and qB = 2, respectively, and the market demand isq = 9. It is the way\\nI explained the market demand schedule in Chapter 1, and perhaps you are comfortable\\nwith interpreting it this way.\\nTo explain the vertical interpretation, though, we need to introduce a new idea. Suppose\\nConsumer A has no apple at present, i.e.q\\nA = 0. What is the maximum amount of money\\nhe/she is willing to give up to get the ﬁrst bite of an apple? We know the consumer is\\nunwilling to pay more than $10 for the ﬁrst bite because the demand is zero if the price\\nis above $10. When the price of an apple is, say, $5, he/she will buy 5 apples so he must\\nbe willing to sacriﬁce at least $5 per apple for the ﬁrst bite. Following this logic, you\\ncan deduce that the amount of money he/she is willing to give up for the very ﬁrst bite\\nof an apple is exactly $10 per apple, which is the height of his/her demand schedule at\\nq\\nA = 0. The height of Consumer A ’s demand schedule becomes smaller as his/her apple\\nconsumption qA increases, showing that the maximum amount of money he/she wishes\\nto sacriﬁce decreases as his/her apple consumption increases. For example, atqA = 5, i.e.\\nhe/she has already had 5 apples, he/she is willing to pay $5 per apple to have the next bite.\\nIn other word, his/hervaluation of that bite of an apple is $5.\\nIn any case, the preceding discussion implies that the height of consumer’s demand\\nschedule shows his/her marginal willingness to pay ( MWTP) or marginal valuation\\n(MV) of the good in question. The notion is applicable to the market demand sched-\\nule. The height of the market demand schedule shows the marginal valuation of the\\ngood in question for the market participants. Interpreting the demand schedule this\\nway is the key to understanding the surplus consumers make by buying goods in the\\nmarket.\\n2\\nTo consolidate the understanding, let us use some numbers to describe the idea. Consider\\nFigure 7.10, and suppose the price an apple is p = 3 and hence the quantity of apples\\ndemanded in the market isq = 9. Note that Consumers A and B buyqA = 7 andqB = 2,\\nrespectively. By looking at the third diagram in the ﬁgure, we know that the marginal\\nvaluation of an apple for the market participants is $3 per apple, i.e.MV (9) = 3. There\\nare two market participants, so for each of them, the value of this next bite must be $3 per\\napple. If you look at two consumers’ marginal valuations whenq\\nA = 7 and qB = 2, they\\nare indeed equal to $3 per apple, i.e. each of them is willing to pay a maximum of $3 per\\napple to have the next bite of an apple.\\n7.4.6 Consumer surplus\\nNow the difference between what the consumer is willing to pay (marginal valuation)\\nand what he/she actually has to pay (market price) can be considered as that consumer’s\\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\n2 Strictly speaking, only under certain circumstances are these two interpretations consistent with each other. The\\ndemand schedule derived following the horizontal interpretation is called theMarshallian (or uncompensated)\\ndemand schedule whereas the one that is derived by the vertical interpretation is called theHicksian (or\\ncompensated) demand schedule.

Suppose the government decides to introduce aproduc-\\ntion tax on beer that is sold. It means that the government taxes the producers (suppliers)\\nof beer. Let us say the tax isT dollars per bottle. Suppliers are legally liable to pay the\\ntax, but it does not mean that they bear the entire tax burden: some burden will be passed\\non to the consumers unless we assume speciﬁc type of demand and/or supply schedules.\\nLet us see why.\\nIn Figure 7.13, PointE shows the equilibrium of the beer market without the tax.

The shelf (or market)\\nprice is the price that is written on the tag of the beer, so it shows the dollar amount that\\nthe buyer actually hands over to the seller. When there is no tax, the shelf price is equal\\nto p\\n∗, so you might wonder why we need pm for this discussion, but it will become clear\\nwhy I introduced it.\\nNow let us think what occurs when the production tax of T is levied. Remember that\\nbeer suppliers will produce so long as the price they receive exceeds their marginal cost\\nof production. So, when the production tax is present, they produce so long as ( pm − T )\\nexceeds the marginal cost of production.\\nSuppose that the suppliers bear the entire tax burden, that is, the shelf price stays the\\nsame at p∗ = pm. It means consumers pay the same price even after the introduction\\nof this tax, and so they bear no tax burden. Then, the quantity of beer demanded will\\nstay the same at q\\n∗ (of course, because they are facing the same price as before), whereas\\nthe suppliers choose quantity q∗∗ (where pm − T = MC(q∗∗)). There will be an excess\\ndemand for beer (distance q∗∗q∗). It means that the shelf price has got to rise. The simple\\nintuition is: when suppliers are taxed, the market supply falls, which drives up the shelf\\nprice.\\nNow we know that the shelf price must rise, but by how much? Let us think about it\\nby using a diagram. Since the new shelf price has to clear the beer market, it has to be\\ndetermined at the level p\\nm illustrated in Figure 7.14.\\nBecause consumers are not legally liable to pay the tax, pm is all they have to pay per\\nbottle of beer: we call this the consumer price pC.

Demand for beer is qT when the consumer price is\\npC (Point D where pC = MV (qT )).\\nSuppliers of beer, when they sell beer, receive pm per bottle from the consumer, but\\nthey have to pay T dollars per bottle to the government. Hence, what they receive per\\nbottle after paying the tax is pP = pm − T : we call this price the producer price. When\\nthe producer price is pP , the supply of beer is qT (point W, where pP = MC(qT )). The\\nbeer market clears and hence the new shelf price,pm, illustrated in Figure 7.14 represents\\nthe equilibrium price under the tax.\\nThe equilibrium level of quantity after the introduction of tax isqT , where the difference\\nbetween MV (= pC) andMC (= pP )i sT . The tax creates this wedge between the demand\\n(MV) and supply ( MC) schedules in the equilibrium and we call it the tax wedge. Both\\nconsumers and producers bear the tax burden. The shelf price is equal to the consumer\\nprice when producers are legally liable to pay the tax.\\n7.5.2 The welfare effects of the tax\\nBefore the introduction of the production tax, the total economic surplus the beer market\\ncreated is represented by the area CBL in Figure 7.15. Let us discuss how the total\\neconomic surplus changes after the introduction of the tax.\\nAs we have seen, when the tax is levied, the shelf price rises and the quantity traded\\nin the market decreases. In Figure 7.15, new consumer surplus and producer surplus\\nare depicted. Consumers are facing the higher price p\\nC and are consuming less, and\\nhence the consumer surplus has decreased. The consumer surplus under the tax is rep-\\nresented by the area Cp\\nCD. Producers are facing the lower price pP and are producing\\nless, and hence the producer surplus has become smaller. The producer surplus under\\nthe tax is represented by the area p\\nP BW. The area pCpP WLD shows the burden of\\nthe tax on consumers and producers. But part of this burden may be transferred back\\nto the market participants. That is, by taxing the producers, the government raises the\\ntax revenue, which is represented by the area p\\nCpP WD. Let us assume this transfer\\nactually occurs. Then, the total economic surplus under the tax is the sum of the consumer\\nsurplus, the producer surplus and the government’s tax revenue.

Notice that on the\\ninterval from q = qT to q = q∗, MV > MC . It means consumers value beer more than is\\nrequired for producers to supply. When there is no tax, the equilibrium level of quantity is\\nq\\n∗ where MV = MC. As we can understand from Figure 7.15, the total economic surplus\\nin this market is maximised when q = q∗, where MV = MC. However, because of the\\nproduction tax, production of beer stops atq = qT <q ∗, where MV ̸= MC. Because the\\nprovision of beer is less than the level that maximises the total economic surplus, we say\\nthat there is under-provision (or under-production) of beer.\\nLet me give you some examples of calculating the deadweight loss mathematically.\\nQuestion A (linear D&S) Assume that the inverse demand function for a particular\\ngood is given as follows: p = 1000 − q. The inverse supply function for this good is\\nknown as the following:p = q. Obtain the deadweight loss when a production tax of $30\\nper unit is levied.

We need to ﬁndqT at which MV −\\nMC = 30:\\n1000 − qT − 30 = qT\\nqT = 485.\\nWhen q = qT = 485, the consumer price and the producer price are pC = 515 and\\npP = 485, respectively. So the deadweight loss (DWL) and the tax revenue (TR ) are:\\nDWL = 30 × 15 × 1\\n2 = 225,\\nTR = 30 × 485 = 14550 (dollars).\\nQuestion B (linear D&S, but more elastic supply) Assume that the inverse demand\\nfunction for a particular good is given as follows: p = 1000 − q (this is the same as\\nin Question A).

Comparing Questions A and\\nB, we can see that more of burden is pushed down on to consumers in Question B. This is\\nbecause the producer surplus became much less in Question B. In Question A, there was\\ngreater producer surplus to absorb the tax.\\nWe can also see that the excess burden (the deadweight loss) is greater in Question B.\\nThat is, there is further under-provision of the good in Question B. Note thatq\\nT = 475 in\\nQuestion B, which is 25 units less thanq∗ = 500, where qT = 485 in Question A, which\\nis 15 units less thanq∗ = 500. It also implies that the government is collecting more tax\\nin Question A. By introducing the same tax (that is, a production tax of $30 per unit), in\\nQuestion A, the government can collect more tax and there is less under-provision of the\\ngood. It appears that if the demand curves are the same, the government should tax the\\ngood that has a steeper supply curve.\\nThis statement can be rewritten using the price elasticity we have studied.

Consequently we let the consumers\\nbear the entire tax burden (see Figure 7.17 from here on), that is, the shelf price (which\\nis equal to the consumer price) goes up by exactly the amount of the production tax,\\np\\nC = pm = p∗ + T , and the producers get pP = p∗ per unit (so the producer price is\\nunchanged after the production tax).

If you look at each of the surplus measures, you\\ncan convince yourselves that it must be true. The producer surplus is unchanged because\\nthe price the producer receives and the quantity traded are unchanged. The consumer\\nsurplus decreases just by the tax revenue the government collected.

There are many things that are unclear. What is meant by the\\ninverse of a matrix? What are matrices in any case? Well, don’t worry, we will learn them\\nin the rest of the appendix.\\nA.1 Matrices and vectors\\nSuppose a ﬁrm hires three workers,i = 1, 2, 3. If we denote workeri’s monthly pay from\\nJanuary to April by wij where j = 1, 2, 3, 4, the pay information can be expressed using\\nthe following array of numbers:\\nW =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nw11 w12 w13 w14\\nw21 w22 w23 w24\\nw31 w32 w33 w34\\n⎞\\n⎠. (A.5)\\nAn array of numbers such as W is called a matrix.I n W there are three rows that\\ncorrespond to workers and four columns that correspond to months, so we call it a 3 × 4\\n(three-by-four) matrix. In general, if the matrix has m rows and n columns, then we say\\nits size (or dimension)i s m-by-n and call it an m × n matrix. Each of the wijsi n W is\\ncalled an entry (or element).\\nIf the ﬁrm wants to know how much it paid to each of their workers in a particular\\nmonth, say in February, it can focus on the second column of W:\\nwi2 =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nw12\\nw22\\nw32\\n⎞\\n⎠. (A.6)\\nWe can see thatwi2 contains only one column. Such a matrix is called a column matrix,\\nor more commonly, a column vector. The ﬁrm may want to know how much it paid to a\\nparticular worker, say Worker 3. In that case, then the third row ofW is the focus:\\nw3j =\\n⎞\\nw31 w32 w33 w34\\n⎠\\n. (A.7)\\nHere, w3j consists of one row only and such a matrix is known to a row matrix or a\\nrow vector.\\nWe say that two matrices are equal if and only if (a) they have the same size; and (b)\\nall corresponding entries are equal. That is, for m × n matrices A and B,w eh a v e :\\nA = B if and only if aij = bij for all i and j.

(A.9)\\nNotice now W is shown with a prime symbol and has becomeW′. The prime indicates\\nthat rows and columns of the original matrix are interchanged. The matrix W′ is called\\nthe transpose of W. Some people use a superscript T to denote the same thing, that is,\\nW′ = WT. Note that the size of the transpose W′ (4 × 3) is different from the size of the\\noriginal matrix W (3 × 4). Quite obviously, we have (W′)′ = W.\\nA.1.2 Special matrices\\nWhen we transpose an m × n matrix, we get an n × m matrix. The sizes of the two\\nmatrices differ if m ̸= n but if m = n the sizes are the same. When m = n a matrix is\\ncalled a square matrixof order m (or n). For example,\\n⎞a11 a12\\na21 a22\\n⎠\\nis a square matrix of\\norder 2.\\nA matrix that is equal to its transpose is called a symmetric matrix. It is obvious that\\na symmetric matrix needs to be a square matrix (because otherwise the transpose has\\na different size). For example,\\n⎞11\\n12\\n⎠\\nis a symmetric matrix but neither\\n⎞10\\n12\\n⎠\\nnor\\n⎞100\\n001\\n⎠\\nis.\\nLet’s consider a symmetric matrix of order n, Wn. The entries wii , i = 1,...,n are\\ncalled the main diagonal entries (or more casually the main diagonals). A diagonal\\nmatrix is a square matrix all of whose off-diagonal entries – i.e. wij, i ̸= j – are zero.\\nFor example,\\n⎞10\\n02\\n⎠\\nand\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nw11 00\\n0 w22 0\\n00 w33\\n⎞\\n⎠are diagonal matrices but\\n⎞01\\n00\\n⎠\\nis not.\\nA special case of the diagonal matrix is when all the main diagonals are unity. In this\\ncase we have anidentity matrix, which we usually denote byIn, where n shows the order\\nof the matrix. For example, I2 =\\n⎞10\\n01\\n⎠\\nand I3 =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n100\\n010\\n001\\n⎞\\n⎠are identity matrices of\\norder 2 and order 3, respectively. The identity matrix in matrix algebra is like ‘one’ in\\n(ordinary) algebra and we shall see how it is used shortly.\\nA zero matrixin matrix algebra is like ‘zero’ in (ordinary) algebra.

(A.10)\\nIn this case – when the size of two matrices are the same – it makes sense to add the\\ntwo matrices to obtain each worker’s aggregate pay for each of the months. It can be done\\nsimply by adding each of the corresponding entries in the two matrices. Denoting the sum\\nof the two matrices by Y =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\ny\\n11 y12 y13 y14\\ny21 y22 y23 y24\\ny31 y32 y33 y34\\n⎞\\n⎠, we can write:\\nY = W + X =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nw11 + x11 w12 + x12 w13 + x13 w14 + x14\\nw21 + x21 w22 + x22 w23 + x23 w24 + x24\\nw31 + x31 w32 + x32 w33 + x33 w34 + x34\\n⎞\\n⎠. (A.11)\\nFor example, in March, Worker 2 earned y23, which is the sum of his pay from two\\nﬁrms w23 + x23.\\nSubtracting operations can be conducted similarly. For example, suppose the\\ninformation on the rents three workers paid each month is summarised by R =⎛\\n⎝\\nr11 r12 r13 r14\\nr21 r22 r23 r24\\nr31 r32 r33 r34\\n⎞\\n⎠, where rij is the rent Worker i paid in Month j. Then the money\\nthat was left in workers’ pockets each month after they paid their rents are given by\\nZ =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nz11 z12 z13 z14\\nz21 z22 z23 z24\\nz31 z32 z33 z34\\n⎞\\n⎠, where:\\nZ = Y − R =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\ny11 − r11 y12 − r12 y13 − r13 y14 − r14\\ny21 − r21 y22 − r22 y23 − r23 y24 − r24\\ny31 − r31 y32 − r32 y33 − r33 y34 − r34\\n⎞\\n⎠.

For example, there is no solution to, say,\\n⎞10\\n01\\n⎠\\n+\\n⎞101\\n010\\n⎠\\n.\\nThere may be some cases where you have to scale up (or down) all entries in a matrix\\nby the same number. For example, suppose each of the workers got a discount on their\\nrents by 10 per cent from January to April. The reduced rents they paid are obtained by\\nscaling down the matrix R by 10 per cent, and we write it as 0.9R, or equivalently, R0.9.\\nMore speciﬁcally,\\nD =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nd\\n11 d12 d13 d14\\nd21 d22 d23 d24\\nd31 d32 d33 d34\\n⎞\\n⎠= 0.9\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nr11 r12 r13 r14\\nr21 r22 r23 r24\\nr31 r32 r33 r34\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n=\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n0.9r11 0.9r12 0.9r13 0.9r14\\n0.9r21 0.9r22 0.9r23 0.9r24\\n0.9r31 0.9r32 0.9r33 0.9r34\\n⎞\\n⎠ (A.13)\\n=\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nr11 r12 r13 r14\\nr21 r22 r23 r24\\nr31 r32 r33 r34\\n⎞\\n⎠0.9,\\nwhere D is the matrix whose entries show the discounted rents. For example, d32 is the\\ndiscounted rent Worker 3 paid in February, which is 90 per cent of the normal rent he\\nwould have paid in the same month (without the discount). The single number used\\nto scale the matrix – in the above case, 0.9 – is called a scalar, and therefore this\\noperation is called the scalar multiplication. As stated above, θR = Rθ, where θ is a\\nscalar.\\nAs in (ordinary) algebra, scalar multiplication has to be conducted before matrix\\naddition (or subtraction) unless the latter operation is in brackets. So quite obviously,\\nθY − D ̸= θ(Y − D). The LHS says ‘conduct scalar multiplication θY ﬁrst then subtract\\nD’ whereas the RHS says ‘subtract D from Y ﬁrst then multiply the difference by θ’. The\\nsubtraction need not be carried out ﬁrst, however, even when you encounter an expression\\nsuch as θ(Y − D). Another way to calculate it is – just as you would do in (ordinary)\\nalgebra – to distribute θ to each of the matrices as follows before taking the difference:\\nθ(Y − D) = θY − θD.\\nNow let us go through some exercises to consolidate our understanding.\\nQuestion Given X =\\n⎞11\\n12\\n⎠\\n, Y =\\n⎞10\\n12\\n⎠\\nand Z =\\n⎞−1 −2\\n31\\n⎠\\n, obtain the\\nfollowing:\\n(1) X + Y,( 2 )X + Z′,( 3 )2X + Y, (4) 3(X + Y) − 2Z.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

There is no\\ncommunicative property in matrix multiplication in general. Therefore when we talk\\nabout the product of two matrices X and Y, it can mean two different things, XY and\\nYX. To avoid this ambiguity, to indicate XY we say that Y is pre-multiplied by X.\\nAlternatively we can say that X is post-multiplied by Y.\\nAlthough the communicative property does not hold in matrix multiplication, associa-\\ntive and distributive properties do just as in multiplication of numbers. That is, provided\\nall operations are deﬁned, we have:\\n(XY)Z = X(YZ),\\nand\\nX (Y ± Z) = XY ± XZ\\n(X ± Y) Z = XZ ± YZ.\\nWe have just seen the order of matrix multiplication matters, but for some square\\nmatrices, it doesn’t. The following cases are worth mentioning. Firstly, when a square\\nmatrix X is multiplied twice, obviously we have XX = XX! The product of two Xsi s\\ndenoted by X\\n2 and we say that X is raised to the power of 2. Secondly, when a square\\nmatrix X is pre-multiplied (or post-multiplied) by an identity matrix of the same order,\\nwe have XI = IX = X. As mentioned before, the identity matrix hence plays a role like\\n‘one’ in (ordinary) algebra. Thirdly, when a square matrix X is pre-multiplied (or post-\\nmultiplied) by a zero matrix of the same order, we have XO = OX = O. It is just like a\\n‘zero’ in (ordinary) algebra. Regardless of whether X is pre-multiplied or post-multiplied\\nby O, the product is a zero matrix.\\nA.2 An inverse of a matrix and the determinant: solving a system\\nof equations\\nFrom here onwards, we focus only on square matrices because we deal with them most\\nin studying economics or econometrics.

(A.54)\\nFor a local maximum (or a minimum), we need to have dy = 0 for any vector\\n⎞dx1\\ndx2\\n⎠\\n,\\nso it is necessary that:\\n⎞\\n∂f(x1,x2)\\n∂x1\\n∂f(x1,x2)\\n∂x2\\n⎠\\n=\\n⎞\\n00\\n⎠\\n. (A.55)\\nHence the ﬁrst-order condition for a local maximum/minimum is represented by (A.55),\\nwhich is essentially the same as (A.49). Now, let us think about the second-order conditions\\nfor a local maximum. The second-order conditions for a local maximum given by (A.50)\\nsay that f (x\\n1,x 2) must be strictly concave at the local maximum with respect to each of\\nx1 and x2. That is, they require that the point in question be the local maximum in each of\\nthe directions x1 and x2. However, we should really consider all the directions to which\\n(x1,x 2) can move other than these two directions. For example, we can consider moving\\na bit towards both the directions x1 and x2 from the point in question. If f (x1,x 2)i sn o t\\nstrictly concave (say it is strictly convex)in that direction, even when it is strictly concave\\nin each of the directions x1 and x2, the point in question cannot not be a local maximum\\nbecause moving a little bit to that direction will increase the value off (x1,x 2). If we make\\nsure that the function is strictly concave in all the directions, i.e. 360 degrees in this case,\\nthen we can say the point in question is a local maximum. This argument explains why\\nwe need (A.51) in addition to (A.50).\\nThe same argument applies to the second-order conditions for a local minimum. The\\nsecond-order conditions for a local minimum given by (A.52) say that f (x\\n1,x 2) must\\nbe strictly convex at the local minimum with respect to each of x1 and x2.H o w e v e r ,a s\\ndiscussed for a local maximum, we ought to make sure that the function is strictly convex\\nin all the directions. Otherwise we cannot guarantee that the point in question is a local\\nmaximum.\\nTo think about the curvature of f (x\\n1,x 2), we take the total differential of Equa-\\ntion (A.53). It is called the second-order total differential, which is denoted by d2y,\\nbecause we totally differentiate the total differential dy. The total differential dy we have\\ndiscussed in the main text (and just before in Equation (A.53)) is therefore sometimes\\ncalled the ﬁrst-order total differential. Bearing in mind that the two partial derivatives\\nare functions of both x\\n1 and x2, let us totally differentiate Equation (A.53) to get the\\nsecond-order total differential of y = f (x1,x 2):\\nd(dy) ≡ d2y = f11dx2\\n1 + f21dx2dx1 + f12dx1dx2 + f22dx2\\n2 .

Recall that f (x) is strictly concave if and only if f ′′(x) < 0. It turns out\\nthat a bi-variate function f (x1,x 2) is strictly concave if and only if the second-order total\\ndifferential is negative for all (dx1,dx 2) ̸= (0, 0).

Look at (A.60). The\\nsign of d\\n2y depends on the product of the matrices x′Fx, which is called the quadratic\\nform. Given a matrix F (which depends on the function in question f (x1,x 2)), the value\\nof the quadratic form depends onx. That is, in general, the quadratic form may be positive,\\nnegative or a zero, depending on x. However, for the point that satisﬁes the ﬁrst-order\\ncondition to be a local maximum, we would like the quadratic form to be negative forany\\nx ̸= 0. For a local minimum, on the other hand, we would like the quadratic form to be\\npositive for any x ̸= 0.\\nWhen x′Fx < 0 for any x ̸= 0, then we say that the quadratic form isnegative deﬁnite\\nand that F is a negative deﬁnite matrix. On the other hand, when x′Fx > 0 for any x ̸= 0,\\nthen we say that the quadratic form is positive deﬁnite and that F is a positive deﬁnite'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

Hence you might wonder why I have bothered\\nto represent the same idea using matrices in Subsection A.3.3. In describing the second-\\norder condition for a local maximum/minimum of a bi-variate function f (x\\n1,x 2), yes,\\nthere seems to be no point using matrices. However, when the function has more than\\ntwo arguments, the second-order conditions become extremely messy. The use of matri-\\nces expedites representing the conditions and also helps to interpret them naturally as an\\nextension of the simplest case (which deals with a function of only two variables). It is\\nbeyond the scope of this appendix to deal with optimisation problems that require the use\\nof matrices bigger than 2 × 2, but I hope that the following discussion at least makes you\\nrealise how useful matrices are.\\n1\\nSuppose we have an n × n matrix. Think about deleting certain rows and the corre-\\nsponding columns of that matrix. For example, for a 3× 3 matrix X =\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nx11 x12 x13\\nx21 x22 x23\\nx31 x32 x33\\n⎞\\n⎠,\\nwe can delete row 1 and column 1 to get\\n⎞x22 x23\\nx32 x33\\n⎠\\n.

It yields three matrices –\\nin fact, they are scalars – x11, x22 and x33. It is trivial, but by deleting zero rows and\\ncolumns we have the original matrix\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nx11 x12 x13\\nx21 x22 x23\\nx31 x32 x33\\n⎞\\n⎠. So, in the end, this process yields\\nseven matrices that are called the principal submatrices.

Hence, we now know that the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for f (x1,...,x n)\\nto be strictly concave (convex) is that F be negative (positive) deﬁnite.\\nWhen we wish to ﬁnd a local maximum/minimum of f (x1,...,x n), for a point that\\nsatisﬁes the ﬁrst-order condition to be a local maximum/minimum, we need to check the\\ncurvature of the function in the neighbourhood of that point. Just as in the two-variable\\ncase, we require the function to be strictly concave (convex) in the neighbourhood of\\nthe point for it to be a local maximum (or minimum, respectively). We also know that\\nthe curvature of the function is summarised by the deﬁniteness of the Hessian matrix F.\\nThat is, f (x\\n1,...,x n) is strictly concave (convex) if and only if F is negative (positive,\\nrespectively) deﬁnite. Hence the second-order condition for the unconstrained optimisation\\nproblem involving n variables can be succinctly summarised as follows.\\nConsider f (x1,x 2,...,x n) and a point that satisﬁes the ﬁrst-order condition for a local\\nmaximum/minimum. The point is:\\nr a local maximum if and only if F evaluated at that point is negative deﬁnite; and\\nr a local minimum if and only if F evaluated at that point is positive deﬁnite.\\nOf course, obtaining the leading principle minors of order n, where n> 2, by hand\\ncan be a tedious task, which involves calculating the determinant of order n> 2( b u t'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

We\\ndid give a verbal explanation as to how the price adjusts when there is excess demand\\n(or excess supply) in the market, but we did not pay much attention to the mathematical\\nrepresentation of the price adjustment process. This appendix provides an introduction to\\ndifference and differential equations that will allow us to shed light on such dynamics.\\nWe will start by introducing the cobweb model of price adjustment, which describes the\\ndynamics of the price adjustment. In our example, it turns out the price adjustment can be\\nrepresented by a linear ﬁrst-order autonomous difference equation in terms of the price.\\nWe will study how to solve this type of difference equation in general. In turn, the linear\\nﬁrst-order autonomous differential equation – a continuous-time version of the same form\\nof difference equation – will be introduced and examined in the context of the demand\\nand supply analysis.\\nB.1 The cobweb model of price adjustment\\nOne of the implicit assumptions in the demand and supply analysis is that sellers make\\ntheir supply decisions after they know the price of the good. But in reality, in most markets\\nsellers tend to be in the situation where they must commit to a supply decision before\\nthey know the price of the good in question. What are the implications of this lag on the\\ndynamics of the market price over time?\\nTo think about this matter, let us start by specifying the demand function:\\nq\\nD\\nt = 100 − 10pt, (B.1)\\nwhere qD\\nt is the quantity of the good demanded in Periodt and pt is the market price that\\nprevails in Period t. It is important to notice that there is a subscript t on each variable,\\nindicating that it is time-dependent. For example, qD\\n1 is the quantity demanded in Period\\n1, and p2 is the price that prevails in the market in Period 2. In reality, time iscontinuous\\nbut here we assume that it evolves discretely. Under this framework, the market clears\\nonce per ﬁxed period of time.\\nIn any case, solving (B.1) forpt the inverse demand function can be written as follows:\\npt = 10 − 1\\n10qD\\nt .

To make the\\nstory simple, let us assume that sellers expect the next period price to equal the current\\nprice. Then we can assume the supply function as follows:\\nq\\nS\\nt = 25 + 5pt−1. (B.3)\\nThis relationship shows that the quantity supplied in period t, qS\\nt , depends on the\\nprevious period price pt−1 (because sellers believe that the current price will be the same\\nas in the previous period). Accordingly, the inverse supply function is:\\npS\\nt−1 =− 5 + 1\\n5pt. (B.4)\\nNow, let us suppose that sellers realise that the price in Period 0 is equal to 2, i.e.p0 = 2.\\nWhat will happen to the quantity supplied in Period 1? We can use Equation (B.3): by\\nsetting t = 1 and substituting p\\n0 = 2, we can get qS\\n1 = 35.\\nSo in Period 0, the sellers will commit to producing 35 units of the good, which will be\\nsupplied to the market in Period 1. Therefore the Period 1 supply is ﬁxed to 35 units at this\\nmoment. Accordingly, for the market to clear in Period 1, the quantity demanded must be\\nq\\nD\\n1 = 35 (otherwise, there exists excess demand or excess supply). Equation (B.2) will\\ngive us the market clearing level of the price in Period 1: by settingt = 1 and substituting\\nqD\\n1 = 35 we can get p1 = 6.5.\\nNow in Period 1, sellers realise that the price is p1 = 6.5 (not 20 as they expected).\\nWhen this information is given to sellers, they adjust their expectation and now expect that\\nthe price in Period 2 will be p\\n2 = 6.5. Therefore, the quantity supplied in Period 2 will\\nbe qS\\n2 = 57.5. Accordingly the market clearing level of price in Period 2 can be obtained\\nby substituting t = 2 in Equation (B.2) and substituting qD\\n2 = 57.5: we get p2 = 4.25.\\nLikewise, the quantity supplied in Period 3 will be determined according to Equa-\\ntion (B.3) (with suppliers expecting p3 = 4.25) as qS\\n3 = 46.25. The market clearing level\\nof price in Period 3 can be obtained by setting t = 3 in Equation (B.2) and substituting\\nqD\\n3 = 46.25: we get p3 = 5.375.\\nWe can follow the above procedure forever, but let us summarise the evolution of pt\\nand qt over time in Table B.1 (note that p0 = 2).'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.1.3 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.6 (c) 1T3XT BVBA', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2013-02-22T13:32:35+04:00', 'author': 'Admin', 'moddate': '2013-02-22T15:00:27+04:00', 'title': 'Asano A.

Consequently the steady state values of price\\nand quantity turn out to be ( ¯p, ¯q) = (5, 50).\\nGiven the initial price p0 = 2, in each period, the price that prevails in the market is\\neither above or below ¯p and, as time goes on, it approaches the steady state price level\\n¯p = 5.
