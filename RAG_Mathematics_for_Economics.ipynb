It assumes very little prerequisite knowledge, so it can be read by students who have not \\nundertaken a mathematics course for some time. The style is informal, and the text contains \\na large number of worked examples. Students are encouraged to tackle problems for themselves \\nas they read through each section. Detailed solutions are provided so that all answers can be \\nchecked. Consequently, it should be possible to work through this text on a self-study basis. \\nThe material is wide ranging and varies from elementary topics such as percentages and \\n linear equations to more sophisticated topics such as constrained optimisation of multivariate \\nfunctions. The text should therefore be suitable for use on both low- and high-level quantita-\\ntive methods courses.\\nThis text was first published in 1991. The prime motivation for writing it then was to  \\ntry to produce a text that students could actually read and understand for themselves.

Each \\n chapter \\nnow ends with both multiple choice questions and a selection of longer examination-style \\n questions. Students usually enjoy tackling multiple choice questions since they provide a quick \\nway of testing recall of the material covered in each chapter. Several universities include multiple \\nchoice as part of their assessment. The final section in each chapter entitled “Examination \\nQuestions” contains longer problems which require knowledge and understanding of more than \\none topic. Although these have been conveniently placed at the end of each chapter it may be \\nbest to leave these until the end of the academic year so that they can be used during the revision \\nperiod just before the examinations.\\nIan Jacques'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 14, 'page_label': 'xii'}, page_content='This page intentionally left blank'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 15, 'page_label': 'xiii'}, page_content=''), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 16, 'page_label': 'xiv'}, page_content='This page intentionally left blank'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 17, 'page_label': '1'}, page_content='INTRODUCTION\\nGetting Started\\nNOTES FOR STUDENTS: HOW TO USE THIS TEXT\\nI am always amazed by the mix of students on first-year economics courses. Some have not \\nacquired any mathematical knowledge beyond elementary algebra (and even that can be of a \\nrather dubious nature), some have never studied economics before in their lives, while others \\nhave passed preliminary courses in both. Whatever category you are in, I hope that you will \\nfind this text of value. The chapters covering algebraic manipulation, simple calculus, finance, \\nmatrices and linear programming should also benefit students on business studies and manage\\n-\\nment courses.\\nThe first few chapters are aimed at complete beginners and students who have not taken \\nmathematics courses for some time. I would like to think that these students once enjoyed \\nmathematics and had every intention of continuing their studies in this area, but somehow never \\nfound the time to fit it into an already overcrowded academic timetable. However, I suspect that \\nthe reality is rather different. Possibly they hated the subject, could not understand it and dropped \\nit at the earliest opportunity. If you find yourself in this position, you are probably horrified to \\ndiscover that you must embark on a quantitative methods course with an examination looming \\non the horizon. However, there is no need to worry. My experience is that every student is \\ncapable of passing a mathematics examination. All that is required is a commitment to study \\nand a willingness to suspend any prejudices about the subject gained at school. The fact that \\nyou have bothered to buy this text at all suggests that you are prepared to do both.\\nTo help you get the most out of this text, let me compare the working practices of  \\neconomics and engineering students. The former rarely read individual books in any great depth. \\nThey tend to skim through a selection of books in the university library and perform a large \\nnumber of Internet searches, picking out relevant information. Indeed, the ability to read selec-\\ntively and to compare various sources of information is an important skill that all arts and \\nsocial science students must acquire. Engineering students, on the other hand, are more likely \\nto read just a few books in any one year. They read each of these from cover to cover and \\nattempt virtually every problem en route. Even though you are most definitely not an engineer, \\nit is the engineering approach that you need to adopt while studying mathematics. There are \\nseveral reasons for this. First, a mathematics text can never be described, even by its most \\nardent admirers, as a good bedtime read. It can take an hour or two of concentrated effort to \\nunderstand just a few pages of a mathematics text. You are therefore recommended to work \\nthrough this text systematically in short bursts rather than to attempt to read whole chapters. \\nEach section is designed to take between one and two hours to complete, and this is quite \\nsufficient for a single session. Secondly, mathematics is a hierarchical subject in which one topic \\nfollows on from the next. A construction firm building an office block is hardly likely to erect \\nthe fiftieth storey without making sure that the intermediate floors and foundations are \\nsecurely in place. Likewise, you cannot ‘dip’ into the middle of a mathematics text  \\nand expect to follow it unless you have satisfied the prerequisites for that topic. Finally, you  \\nactually need to do mathematics yourself before you can understand it. No matter how  \\nwonderful your lecturer is, and no matter how many problems are discussed in class, it is only'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 18, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='2  INTRODUCTION  Gettin G Started\\nby solving problems yourself that you are ever going to become confident in using and applying \\nmathematical techniques. For this reason, several problems are interspersed within the text, and \\nyou are encouraged to tackle these as you go along. You will require writing paper, graph paper, \\npens and a calculator for this. There is no need to buy an expensive calculator unless you are \\nfeeling particularly wealthy at the moment. A bottom-of-the-range scientific calculator should \\nbe good enough. Answers to every question are printed at the back of this text so that you \\ncan check your own answers quickly as you go along. However, please avoid the temptation \\nto look at them until you have made an honest attempt at each one. Remember that in the \\nfuture you may well have to sit down in an uncomfortable chair, in front of a blank sheet of \\npaper, and be expected to produce solutions to examination questions of a similar type.\\nAt the end of each section there are two parallel exercises. The non-starred exercises  \\nare intended for students who are meeting these topics for the first time and the questions are \\ndesigned to consolidate basic principles. The starred exercises are more challenging but still \\ncover the full range so that students with greater experience will be able to concentrate their \\nefforts on these questions without having to pick-and-mix from both exercises. The chapter \\ndependence is shown in Figure I.1. If you have studied some advanced mathematics before, \\nyou will discover that parts of Chapters 1, 2 and 4 are familiar. However, you may find that \\nthe sections on economics applications contain new material. You are best advised to test \\nyourself by attempting a selection of problems from the starred exercise in each section to  \\nsee if you need to read through it as part of a refresher course. Economics students in a  \\ndesperate hurry to experience the delights of calculus can miss out Chapter 3 without any  \\nloss of continuity and move straight on to Chapter 4. The mathematics of finance is probably \\nmore relevant to business and account\\n ancy students, although you can always read it later if \\nit is part of your economics syllabus.\\nAt the end of every chapter you will find a multiple choice test and some examination \\nquestions. These cover the work of the whole chapter. We recommend that you try the  \\nmultiple choice questions when you have completed the relevant chapter.

This is an  \\nobvious first choice in an introductory text, since it is an easy topic which has many applications. \\nThere are seven sections, which are intended to be read in the order that they appear.\\nSections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.6 are devoted to mathematical methods. They serve to revise the \\nrules of arithmetic and algebra, which you probably met at school but may have forgotten. In \\nparticular, the properties of negative numbers and fractions are considered. A reminder is given \\non how to multiply out brackets and how to manipulate mathematical expressions. You are also \\nshown how to solve simultaneous linear equations. Systems of two equations in two unknowns \\ncan be solved using graphs, which are described in Section 1.3. However, the preferred method \\nuses elimination, which is considered in Section 1.4. This algebraic approach has the advantage \\nthat it always gives an exact solution and it extends readily to larger systems of equations.\\nThe remaining two sections are reserved for applications in microeconomics and macroeconomics. \\nYou may be pleasantly surprised by how much economic theory you can analyse using just the \\nbasic mathematical tools considered here. Section 1.5 introduces the fundamental concept of an \\neconomic function and describes how to calculate equilibrium prices and quantities in supply and \\ndemand theory. Section 1.7 deals with national income determination in simple macroeconomic \\nmodels.\\nThe first six sections underpin the rest of the text and are essential reading.

Doubtless there are a few  \\nenthusiasts who get a kick out of algebraic manipulation, but economics and business students \\nare rarely to be found in this category. Indeed, the mere mention of the word ‘algebra’ is \\nenough to strike fear into the heart of many a first-year student. Unfortunately, you cannot \\nget very far with mathematics unless you have completely mastered this topic. An apposite \\nanalogy is the game of chess. Before you can begin to play a game of chess, it is necessary to \\ngo through the tedium of learning the moves of individual pieces.

Make sure that you do the problems as they arise, checking your answers with \\nthose provided at the back of this text. The material has been broken down into three subsections:\\n● negative numbers;\\n● expressions;\\n● brackets.\\nYou might like to work through these subsections on separate occasions to enable the ideas to sink \\nin.

In pure mathematics the most common  \\nletters used are x and y. However, in applications it is helpful to choose letters that are more \\nmeaningful, so we might use Q for quantity and I for investment. An algebraic expression  \\nis then simply a combination of these letters, brackets and other mathematical symbols such \\nas + or −. For example, the expression\\nP r\\nn\\n1 /uni002B 100\\ncan be used to work out how money in a savings account grows over a period of time.  \\nThe letters P, r and n represent the original sum invested (called the principal – hence the use \\nof the letter P), the rate of interest and the number of years, respectively. To work it all out, \\nyou not only need to replace these letters by actual numbers, but you also need to understand \\nthe various conventions that go with algebraic expressions such as this.\\nIn algebra, when we multiply two numbers represented by letters, we usually suppress the \\nmultiplication sign between them. The product of a and b would simply be written as ab \\nwithout bothering to put the multiplication sign between the symbols. Likewise, when a  \\nnumber represented by the letter Y is doubled, we write 2Y. In this case we not only suppress \\nthe multi\\n plication sign but adopt the convention of writing the number in front of the letter. \\nHere are some further examples:\\nP × Q is written as PQ\\nd × 8 is written as 8d\\nn × 6 × t is written as 6nt\\nz × z is written as z2 (using the index 2 to indicate squaring a number)\\n1 × t is written as t (since multiplying by 1 does not change a number)'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 26, 'page_label': '10'}, page_content='10  c hApter 1  LInEAr Eq UATIonS\\nIn order to evaluate these expressions it is necessary to be given the numerical value of \\neach letter. Once this has been done, you can work out the final value by performing the \\noperations in the following order:\\nBrackets first (B)\\nIndices second (I)\\nDivision and Multiplication third (DM)\\nAddition and Subtraction fourth (AS)\\nThis is sometimes remembered using the acronym BIDMAS, and it is essential to use this \\nordering for working out all mathematical calculations. For example, suppose you wish to \\nevaluate each of the following expressions when \\nn = 3:\\n2n2 and (2n)2\\nSubstituting n = 3 into the first expression gives\\n 2n2 = 2 × 32 (the multiplication sign is revealed when we switch from algebra to numbers)\\n = 2 × 9 (according to BIDMAS, indices are worked out before multiplication)\\n = 18\\nwhereas in the second expression we get\\n (2n)2 = (2 × 3)2 (again, the multiplication sign is revealed)\\n = 62 (according to BIDMAS, we evaluate the inside of the brackets first)\\n = 36\\nThe two answers are not the same, so the order indicated by BIDMAS really does matter. \\nLooking at the previous list, notice that there is a tie between multiplication and division  \\nfor third place, and another tie between addition and subtraction for fourth place. These \\npairs of operations have equal priority, and under these circumstances you work from left to \\nright when evaluating expressions.

The process of removing brackets is called ‘expand-\\ning brackets’ or ‘multiplying out brackets’. This is based on the \\ndistributive law, which states \\nthat for any three numbers a, b and c\\na(b 1 c) 5 ab 1 ac\\nIt is easy to verify this law in simple cases. For example, if a = 2, b = 3 and c = 4, then the \\nleft-hand side is\\n2(3 + 4) = 2 × 7 = 14\\nHowever,\\nab = 2 × 3 = 6  and ac = 2 × 4 = 8\\nand so the right-hand side is 6 + 8, which is also 14.\\nThis law can be used when there are any number of terms inside the brackets. We have\\na(b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad\\na(b + c + d + e) = ab + ac + ad + ae\\nand so on.\\n(b) The terms 4P and 2Q are unlike because one is a multiple of P and the other is a multiple \\nof Q, so the expression cannot be simplified.\\n(c) The first and last are like terms since they are both multiples of w , so we can collect \\nthese together and write\\n3w + 9w2 + 2w = 5w + 9w2\\nThis cannot be simpified any further because 5w and 9w 2 are unlike terms.\\n(d) The terms 3xy and 4xy are like terms, and 9x and 8x are also like terms.

However, it is important to realise that these formulae \\nmay be valid only for a restricted range of values. Most large companies have a policy to \\nreimburse employees for use of their cars for travel: for the first 50 miles they may be able  \\nto claim 90 cents a mile, but this could fall to 60 cents a mile thereafter. If the distance,  \\nx miles, is no more than 50 miles, then travel expenses, E (in dollars), could be worked out \\nusing the formula \\nE = 0.9x. If x exceeds 50 miles, the employee can claim $0.90 a mile for the \\nfirst 50 miles but only $0.60 a mile for the last (x − 50) miles. The total amount is then\\nE = 0.9 × 50 + 0.6(x − 50)\\n= 45 + 0.6x − 30\\n= 15 + 0.6x\\nTravel expenses can therefore be worked out using two separate formulae:\\n●\\t E = 0.9x when x is no more than 50 miles\\n●\\t E = 15 + 0.6x when x exceeds 50 miles.\\nBefore we leave this topic, a word of warning is in order. Be careful when removing brackets \\nfrom very simple expressions such as those considered in part (c) in the previous worked \\nexample and practice problem. A common mistake is to write\\n(a + b) − (c + d) = a + b − c + d  This is NOT true\\nThe distributive law tells us that the −1 multiplying the second bracket applies to the d as \\nwell as the c, so the correct answer has to be\\n(a + b) − (c + d) = a + b − c − d\\nIn algebra, it is sometimes useful to reverse the procedure and put the brackets back in.  \\nThis is called factorisation. Consider the expression 12a + 8b. There are many numbers which \\ndivide into both 8 and 12. However, we always choose the biggest number, which is 4 in this \\ncase, so we attempt to take the factor of 4 outside the brackets:\\n12a + 8b = 4(? + ?)\\nAdvice\\nIn this example the solutions are written out in painstaking detail.

The letters x, y and z are used to represent numbers, so the  \\nrules for the manipulation of algebraic fractions are the same as those for ordinary numerical  \\nfractions. It is therefore essential that you are happy manipulating numerical fractions without \\na calculator so that you can extend this skill to fractions with letters.\\nTwo fractions are said to be \\nequivalent if they represent the same numerical value.

You eat the same amount of chocolate as someone who breaks the bar into eight equal \\npieces and eats six of them. Each piece is only half the size so you need to compensate by eating \\ntwice as many.

In this example we have\\n3\\n4\\n3 3 26\\n85 4 3 2 5\\nThis process can be reversed so equivalent fractions are produced when the numerator and \\ndenominator are both divided by the same number. For example,\\n16\\n24\\n16/8\\n24/8\\n2\\n355\\nso the fractions 16/24 and 2/3 are equivalent. A fraction is said to be in its simplest form or \\nreduced to its lowest terms when there are no factors common to both the numerator and \\ndenominator.

Compare these with statements such as: \\n    7 x  − 1 = 13    \\n or \\n     x  2  − 5 x  = 1    \\n These relations are called    equations    and are only true for particular values of  x  which \\nneed to be found.

The latter is called a quadratic equation and will be considered in \\nthe next chapter. \\n One naïve approach to the solution of equations such as \\n7 x  − 1 = 13 might be to use trial \\nand error: that is, we could just keep guessing values of  x  until we fi  nd the one that works. \\nCan you see what  x  is in this case? However, a more reliable and systematic approach is \\nto actually solve this equation using the rules of mathematics. In fact, the only rule that we \\nneed is: \\n  you can apply whatever mathematical operation you like to an equation,  \\nprovided that you do the same thing to both sides   \\n There is only one exception to this rule: you must never divide both sides by zero.

Both lines are sketched on the same piece of graph paper and the coordinates  \\nof the point of intersection are then simply read off from the diagram. Unfortunately, this \\napproach has several drawbacks. It is not always easy to decide on a suitable scale for the \\naxes. Even if the scale allows all four points (two from each line) to fit on the diagram, there \\nis no guarantee that the point of intersection itself also lies on it. When this happens, you \\nhave no alternative but to throw away your graph paper and to start again, choosing a \\nsmaller scale in the hope that the solution will now fit. The second drawback concerns the \\naccuracy of the graphical solution. All of the problems in Section 1.3 were deliberately chosen \\nso that the answers had nice numbers in them; whole numbers such as −1, 2 and 5 or, at \\nworst, simple fractions such as \\n1/2, 21/2 and −1/4. In practice, the coefficients of the equations \\nmay well involve decimals and we might expect a decimal solution. Indeed, even if the coef-\\nficients are whole numbers, the solution itself could involve nasty fractions such as 7/8 or \\nperhaps something like 231/571. A moment’s thought should convince you that in these cir-\\ncumstances it is virtually impossible to obtain the solution graphically, even if we use a really \\nlarge scale and our sharpest HB pencil in the process. The final drawback concerns the nature \\nof the problem itself. Quite frequently in economics, we need to solve three equations in three \\nunknowns or maybe four equations in four unknowns. Unfortunately, the graphical method \\nof solution does not extend to these cases.\\nIn this section an alternative method of solution is described which relies on algebra. It is \\ncalled the \\nelimination method, since each stage of the process eliminates one (or more) of the \\nunknowns. This method always produces the exact solution and can be applied to systems of \\nequations larger than just two equations in two unknowns.

We describe how the mathematics \\nintroduced in the previous two sections can be used to calculate the equilibrium price and \\nquantity. However, before we do this it is useful to explain the concept of a function. This \\nidea is central to nearly all applications of mathematics in economics.\\nA \\nfunction, f, is a rule which assigns to each incoming number, x, a uniquely defined out -\\ngoing number, y. A function may be thought of as a ‘black box’ that performs a dedicated \\narithmetic calculation. As an example, consider the rule ‘double and add 3’. The effect of this \\nrule on two specific incoming numbers, 5 and −17, is illustrated in Figure 1.13.\\nUnfortunately, such a representation is rather cumbersome. There are, however, two \\nalternative ways of expressing this rule which are more concise. We can write either\\ny = 2x + 3 or f (x) = 2x + 3\\nThe first of these is familiar to you from our previous work; corresponding to any incoming \\nnumber, x, the right-hand side tells you what to do with x to generate the outgoing number, y. \\ndouble and\\nadd 3\\ndouble and\\nadd 3\\n5\\nIN OUT\\n13\\n]17 ]31\\nFigure 1.13'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 84, 'page_label': '68'}, page_content='68  c hApter 1  LInEAr Eq UATIonS\\nThe second notation is also useful. It has the advantage that it involves the label f, which is \\nused to name the rule. If, in a piece of economic theory, there are two or more functions, we \\ncan use different labels to refer to each one. For example, a second function might be\\ng(x) = −3x + 10\\nand we subsequently identify the respective functions simply by referring to them by name: \\nthat is, as either f or g.\\nThe new notation also enables the information conveyed in Figure 1.13 to be written\\nf(5) = 13  read ‘f of 5 equals 13’\\nf(−17) = −31  read ‘f of ]17 equals ]31’\\nThe number inside the brackets is the incoming value, x, and the right-hand side is the  \\ncorresponding outgoing value, y.\\npractice problem\\n1.

The value of y clearly ‘depends’ on the actual value of x that is fed \\ninto the function. For example, in microeconomics the quantity demanded, Q, of a good \\ndepends on the market price, P. We might express this as\\nQ = f (P)\\nSuch a function is called a demand function. Given any particular formula for f (P), it is then \\na simple matter to produce a picture of the corresponding demand curve on graph paper. \\nThere is, however, a difference of opinion between mathematicians and economists on how \\nthis should be done. If your quantitative methods lecturer is a mathematician, then that per-\\nson is likely to plot Q on the vertical axis and P on the horizontal axis. Economists, on the \\nother hand, normally plot them the other way round, with Q on the horizontal axis. In doing \\nso, we are merely noting that since Q is related to P, then, conversely, P must be related to \\nQ, and so there is a function of the form\\nP = g(Q)\\nThe two functions, f and g, are said to be inverse functions : that is, f is the inverse of g  \\nand, equivalently, g is the inverse of f.

These include the incomes of consumers, Y, the price of substitutable goods, \\nP\\nS, the price of complementary goods, PC, advertising expenditure, A, and consumers’ tastes, T. \\nA substitutable good is one that could be consumed instead of the good under consideration. \\nFor example, in the transport industry, buses and taxis could obviously be substituted for \\neach other in urban areas. A \\ncomplementary good is one that is used in conjunction with other \\ngoods. For example, laptops and printers are consumed together. Mathematically, we say \\nthat Q is a function of P, Y, P\\nS, PC, A and T. This is written as\\nQ = f(P, Y, PS, PC, A, T)\\nwhere the variables inside the brackets are separated by commas.

This \\nis constructed on the assumption that Y, PS, PC, A and T are all constant. Notice that when the \\nprice is P* the quantity demanded is Q 1. Now suppose that income, Y, increases. We would \\nnormally expect the demand to rise because the extra income buys more goods at price P *. \\nThe effect is to shift the demand curve to the right because at price P* consumers can afford \\nthe larger number of goods, Q2. From Figure 1.18 we deduce that if the demand curve is\\nP = aQ + b\\nthen a rise in income causes the intercept, b, to increase.\\nWe conclude that if one of the exogenous variables changes, then the whole demand curve \\nmoves, whereas if one of the endogenous variables changes, we simply move along the fixed \\ncurve.\\nIncidentally, it is possible that, for some goods, an increase in income actually causes the \\ndemand curve to shift to the left. In the 1960s and 1970s, most western economies saw a \\ndecline in the domestic consumption of coal as a result of an increase in income. In this case, \\nhigher wealth meant that more people were able to install central heating systems which use \\nalternative forms of energy. Under these circumstances the good is referred to as an \\ninferior \\ngood. On the other hand, a normal good  is one whose demand rises as income rises. Cars  \\nand electrical goods are obvious examples of normal goods. Currently, concern about global \\nwarming is also reducing demand for coal. This factor can be incorporated as part of taste, \\nalthough it is difficult to handle mathematically since it is virtually impossible to quantify \\ntaste and so to define T numerically.\\nThe \\nsupply function is the relation between the quantity, Q, of a good that producers  \\nplan to bring to the market and the price, P, of the good.

In this section we focus on one particular aspect known as national income deter -\\nmination. We describe how to set up simple models of the national economy which enable \\nequilibrium levels of income to be calculated. Initially we assume that the economy is divided \\ninto two sectors, households and firms. Firms use resources such as land, capital, labour and raw \\nmaterials to produce goods and services. These resources are known as \\nfactors of production and \\nare taken to belong to households. national income represents the flow of income from firms \\nto households given as payment for these factors. Households can then spend this money in \\none of two ways. Income can be used for the consumption of goods produced by firms, or it \\ncan be put into savings. Consumption, C, and savings, S, are therefore functions of income, Y: \\nthat is,\\nC = f(Y)\\nS = g(Y)\\nfor some appropriate consumption function, f, and savings function, g. Moreover, C and S are \\nnormally expected to increase as income rises, so f and g are both increasing functions.\\nWe begin by analysing the  consumption function. As usual we need to quantify the precise \\nrelationship between C and Y. If this relationship is linear, then a graph of a typical consumption \\nfunction is shown in Figure 1.22. It is clear from this graph that if\\nC = aY + b\\nthen a > 0 and b > 0. The intercept b is the level of consumption when there is no income  \\n(that is, when Y = 0) and is known as autonomous consumption. The slope, a, is the change in \\nC brought about by a 1-unit increase in Y and is known as the marginal propensity to consume \\n(MPC). As previously noted, income is used up in consumption and savings, so that\\nY = C + S\\nIt follows that only a proportion of the 1-unit increase in income is consumed; the rest goes into \\nsavings. Hence the slope, a, is generally smaller than 1: that is, \\na < 1. It is standard practice in \\nmathematics to collapse the two separate inequalities a > 0 and a < 1 into the single inequality\\n0 < a < 1'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 110, 'page_label': '94'}, page_content='94  c hApter 1  LInEAr Eq UATIonS\\nThe relation\\nY = C + S\\nenables the precise form of the savings function to be determined from any given consumption \\nfunction.\\nTo be specific, suppose that the consumption function is given by\\nC = 0.6Y + 10\\nThe graph is sketched in Figure 1.23 using the fact that it passes through (0, 10) and (40, 34).\\nTo find the savings function we use the relation\\nY = C + S\\nwhich gives\\nS = Y − C.

This is indicated by the dashed line in Figure 1.28. The point of \\nintersection shifts both downwards and to the right.

Emphasis is placed throughout on making \\nboth the mathematics and economic applications as accessible as possible. Hopefully this will \\nhelp you to understand and enjoy the subject. However, it could well be that your lecturers \\nuse more formal language and notation. For this reason we conclude each chapter with a brief \\ndiscussion of more rigorous mathematical language and ideas which provide the framework \\nfor more advanced courses which you may take in future years.\\nIn Section 1.2 a number line was used to represent the solutions of linear inequalities.  \\nThe set of all numbers which lie between two values on the number line is called an \\ninterval \\nand the notation that we use is summarised in the following table:\\ninterval notation\\na ≤ x ≤ b [a, b]\\na < x < b (a, b)\\na ≤ x < b [a, b)\\na < x ≤ b (a, b]\\nThe first interval, which includes both end points, is called a closed interval and the second, \\nwhich excludes the end points, is called an open interval. Using this notation we would write \\n[2, 5] as an abbreviation for 2 ≤ x ≤ 5 and (3, 9] as an abbreviation for 3 < x ≤ 9. It is also \\npossible to use this notation to include intervals which are unbounded. For example, the inter-\\nval x ≥ 6 , which consists of all numbers to the right of 6 on the number line (including  \\n6 itself), can be written as [6, ∞). The symbol ∞ (infinity) is not a number but merely indicates \\nthat the interval goes on forever without an upper limit. In this notation we could write the \\ncomplete set of numbers as (−∞, ∞).\\nIt is often convenient in mathematics to ignore the sign of a number and deliberately make \\nit positive. This is called the \\nabsolute value or modulus of a number, x, and is written u  x u. In \\nthis notation we have\\n u−5 u = 5 and u  4 u = 4\\nIf a number is negative, we change the sign to make it positive, whereas if the number is \\nalready positive, it is unchanged, so we have\\nu\\n x u = −x if x < 0 and u x u = x if x ≥ 0\\n➜'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 126, 'page_label': '110'}, page_content='110  c hApter 1  LInEAr Eq UATIonS\\nSolution\\n(a) If the absolute value of a number x is less than or equal to 6, then the number itself \\nmust be between −6 and 6 inclusive, so the solution of the inequality u x u ≤ 6 can be \\nexpressed in interval notation as [−6, 6].\\n(b) If the absolute value of a number 2x − 1 is less than 3, then the number itself must be \\nbetween −3 and 3, so we need to solve\\n−3 < 2x − 1 < 3\\n−2 < 2x < 4 (add 1 to both sides)\\n−1 < x < 2 (divide both sides by 2)\\nIn interval notation this is written (−1, 2).\\nIn Section 1.5 we introduced the key concept of a function. The domain of a function  \\nconsists of the set of all possible inputs, and the set of corresponding outputs is called the \\nrange of the function. Sometimes we are forced to restrict the inputs to a function because  \\nit is impossible to evaluate the function for certain values of x. For example, it is impossible \\nto evaluate f(4) for the function\\nf (x) 5 1\\nx 2 4\\nIf you try to substitute x = 4  into this function, you get ‘1/0’ which is meaningless. On a  \\ncalculator you get a message ‘division by zero’ error. For this function the domain consists of \\nall numbers, \\nx Þ 4. It is impossible to evaluate x 2 3f(x) 5  for values of x which are less than \\n3 because it is impossible to find the square root of negative numbers. For this function the \\ndomain consists of all numbers, \\nx ≥ 3, so in interval notation, the domain is [3, ∞).\\nSometimes we choose to restrict the domain of a function so that it makes economic sense. \\nFor example, in the demand function, P = −2Q + 50 , sketched in Figure 1.15, we would \\nchoose the domain as [0, 25]. We obviously need to exclude negative quantities from the \\ndomain and the graph shows that if Q exceeds 25, then P would be negative which is non-\\nsense. From a purely mathematical point of view , there is no problem inputting any number \\ninto the function. The line drawn in Figure 1.15 just goes on forever in each direction. \\nHowever, for the function to be economically meaningful we would choose to restrict the \\ndomain to [0, 25]. If we do this, then the vertical axis in Figure 1.15 also shows that the cor -\\nresponding outputs consist of all possible numbers between 0 and 50. In other words, the \\nrange of the function is [0, 50].\\nMathematical notation exists to make the subject precise and unambiguous. It also provides \\na convenient shorthand to reduce the amount of writing that we need to do.

For convenience, different \\nscales are used on the x and y axes.\\nMathematicians call this curve a \\nparabola, whereas economists refer to it as U-shaped. \\nNotice that the graph is symmetric about the y axis with a minimum point at the origin; if a \\nmirror is placed along the y axis, then the left-hand part is the image of the right-hand part.\\n23 22 211\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n23 x\\ny\\ny 5 x2 \\nFigure 2.1'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 145, 'page_label': '129'}, page_content='Secti On 2.1  QuADrATIC FuNCTIoNS  129\\nThe results of Practice Problem 3 suggest that the graph of a quadratic is always parabolic. \\nFurthermore, whenever the coefficient of x 2 is positive, the graph bends upwards and is a \\n‘happy’ parabola (U shape).

By making reasonable simplifying assumptions, the profit function is shown to be \\nquadratic and so the methods developed in Section 2.1 can be used to analyse its properties. \\nWe describe how to find the levels of output required for a firm to break even and to maxim-\\nise profit. The \\nprofit function is denoted by the Greek letter π (pi, pronounced ‘pie’) and is \\ndefined to be the difference between total revenue, TR, and total cost, TC: that is,\\nπ = TR − TC\\nThis definition is entirely sensible because TR is the amount of money received by the firm \\nfrom the sale of its goods, and TC is the amount of money that the firm has to spend to pro-\\nduce these goods. We begin by considering the total revenue and total cost functions in turn.\\nThe \\ntotal revenue received from the sale of Q goods at price P is given by\\nTR = PQ\\nFor example, if the price of each good is $70 and the firm sells 300, then the revenue is\\n$70 × 300 = $21 000\\nGiven any particular demand function, expressing P in terms of Q, it is a simple matter to \\nobtain a formula for TR solely in terms of Q.

This fact should come as no surprise to you; if no goods are sold, the revenue must  \\nbe zero.\\nWe now turn our attention to the total cost function, TC, which relates the production \\ncosts to the level of output, Q. As the quantity produced rises, the corresponding cost also \\nrises, so the TC function is increasing. However, in the short run, some of these costs are \\nfixed. \\nFixed costs, FC, include the cost of land, equipment, rent and possibly skilled labour. \\nObviously, in the long run all costs are variable, but these particular costs take time to vary, \\nso they can be thought of as fixed in the short run. \\nVariable costs, on the other hand, vary with \\noutput and include the cost of raw materials, components, energy and unskilled labour. If VC \\ndenotes the variable cost per unit of output, then the total variable cost, TVC, in producing \\nQ goods is given by\\nTVC = (VC)Q\\nThe total cost is the sum of the contributions from the fixed and variable costs, so is  \\ngiven by\\nTC = FC + (VC)Q\\nNow, although this is an important economic function, it does not always convey the  \\ninformation necessary to compare individual firms. For example, suppose that an inter -\\nnational car company operates two plants, one in the United States and one in Europe, and \\nsuppose that the total annual costs are known to be $200 million and $45 million, respec-\\ntively. Which of these two plants is regarded as the more efficient? Unfortunately, unless we \\nalso know the total number of cars produced, it is impossible to make any judgement. The \\nsignificant function here is not the total cost, but rather the average cost per car. If the US and \\nEuropean plants manufacture 80\\n  000 and 15  000 cars, respectively, their corresponding aver-\\nage costs are\\n200 000 000\\n80 000 5 2500\\nand\\n45 000 000\\n15 000 5 3000\\nOn the basis of these figures, the US plant appears to be the more efficient.

The intercept is FC and the slope is VC. For the average cost function\\nAC 5        1 VCFC\\nQ\\nnote that if Q is small, then FC/Q is large, so the graph bends sharply upwards as Q \\napproaches zero. As Q increases, FC/Q decreases and eventually tails off to zero for large \\nvalues of Q. The AC curve therefore flattens off and approaches VC as Q gets larger and \\nlarger. This phenom\\n enon is hardly surprising, since the fixed costs are shared between more \\nand more goods, so have little effect on AC for large Q. The graph of AC therefore has the \\nbasic L shape shown in Figure 2.9. This effect, in which the average cost decreases as the \\nnumber of units produced increases, is one reason for economies of scale, which encourage \\nthe growth of large organisations. This discussion assumes that VC is a constant. In practice, \\nthis may not be the case, and VC might depend on Q. The TC graph is then no longer linear \\nand the AC graph becomes U-shaped rather than L-shaped. Examples of this can be found in \\nQuestions 5 and 11 in Exercise 2.2 at the end of this section.\\nFigure 2.10 shows typical TR and TC graphs sketched on the same diagram.

What interpretation are we going to put on a number such \\nas 163/4? To be consistent with our previous definitions, the numerator, 3, can be thought of \\nas an instruction for us to raise 16 to the power of 3, and the denominator tells us to take the \\nfourth root.

For the moment, we concentrate on one specific application where we see these ideas in \\naction. The output, Q, of any production process depends on a variety of inputs, known as  \\nfactors of production. These comprise land, capital, labour and enterprise. For simplicity, we \\nrestrict our attention to capital and labour. capital, K, denotes all man-made aids to produc-\\ntion such as buildings, tools and plant machinery. Labour, L, denotes all paid work in the \\nproduction process. The dependence of Q on K and L may be written as\\nQ = f(K, L)\\nwhich is called a production function. Once this relationship is made explicit, in the form of a \\nformula, it is straightforward to calculate the level of production from any given combina-\\ntion of inputs. For example, if\\nQ = 100K1/3L1/2\\nthen the inputs K = 27 and L = 100 lead to an output\\nQ = 100(27)1/3(100)1/2\\n= 100(3)(10)\\n= 3000\\nOf particular interest is the effect on output when inputs are scaled in some way. If capital \\nand labour both double, does the production level also double, does it go up by more than \\ndouble or does it go up by less than double? For the particular production function,\\nQ = 100K1/3L1/2\\nwe see that, when K and L are replaced by 2K and 2L, respectively,\\nQ = 100(2K )1/3(2L)1/2\\nNow, by rule 4,\\n(2K)1/3 = 21/3K1/3 and (2L)1/2 = 21/2L1/2\\nso\\nQ = 100(21/3K1/3)(21/2L1/2)\\n= (21/321/2)(100K1/3L1/2)\\nThe second term, 100K 1/3L1/2, is just the original value of Q, so we see that the output is  \\nmultiplied by\\n21/321/2\\nUsing rule 1, this number may be simplified by adding the indices to get\\n21/321/2 = 25/6\\nMoreover, because 5/6 is less than 1, the scale factor is smaller than 2. In fact, my calculator gives\\n25/6 = 1.78 (to two decimal places)\\nso output goes up by just less than double.\\nIt is important to notice that the above argument does not depend on the particular value, \\n2, that is taken as the scale factor. Exactly the same procedure can be applied if the inputs, K \\nand L, are scaled by a general number l (where l is a Greek letter pronounced ‘lambda’). \\nReplacing K and L by lK and lL, respectively, in the formula\\nQ = 100K1/3L1/2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 176, 'page_label': '160'}, page_content='160  c hapter 2  NoN-lINEAr EQuATIoNS\\ngives\\nQ = 100(lK)1/3(lL)1/2\\n= 100l1/3K1/3l1/2L1/2 (rule 4)\\n= (l1/3l1/2)(100K1/3L1/2)\\n= l5/6(100K1/3L1/2) (rule 1)\\nWe see that the output gets scaled by l5/6, which is smaller than l since the power, 5/6, is less than 1. \\nWe describe this by saying that the production function exhibits decreasing returns to scale.\\nIn general, a function\\nQ = f(K, L)\\nis said to be homogeneous if\\nf(lK, lL) = lnf(K, L)\\nfor some number, n.

It turns out that there is one base (the number e = 2.718  281 . . .)  \\nthat is particularly important in mathematics. The purpose of this section is to introduce you \\nto this strange number and to consider a few simple applications.\\nWe begin by investigating the graphs of the functions,\\nf(x) = 2x and g(x) = 2−x\\nAs we pointed out in Section 2.3, a number such as 2 x is said to be in exponential form. The \\nnumber 2 is called the base and x is called the exponent. Values of this function are easily \\nfound either by pressing the power key \\nxy  on a calculator or by using the definition of bn given \\nin Section 2.3. A selection of these is given in the following table:\\nx −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5\\n2x 0.125 0.25 0.5 1 2 4 8 16 32\\nA graph of f (x) based on this table is sketched in Figure 2.12. Notice that the graph \\napproaches the x axis for large negative values of x, and it rises rapidly as x increases.\\nA graph of the negative exponential, g(x) = 2−x, shown in Figure 2.13, is based on the  \\nfollowing table of values:\\nx −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3\\n2−x 32 16 8 4 2 1 0.5 0.25 0.125\\nThis function is sketched in Figure 2.13. It is worth noticing that the numbers appearing \\nin the table of 2−x are the same as those of 2x but arranged in reverse order. Hence the graph \\nof 2−x is obtained by reflecting the graph of 2x in the y axis.\\nFigure 2.12 displays the graph of a particular exponential function, 2x.

Percentages are used to calculate \\nand interpret index numbers, and to adjust value data for inflation.\\nSection 3.2 shows how to calculate the future value of a lump sum which is invested to earn \\ninterest. This interest can be added to the investment annually, semi-annually, quarterly or even \\nmore frequently. The exponential function is used to solve problems in which interest is com-\\npounded continuously.\\nA wide variety of applications are considered in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. In Section 3.3 a mathemat-\\nical device known as a geometric progression, which is used to calculate the future value of a \\nsavings plan and the monthly repayments of a loan, is introduced. Section 3.4 describes the \\nopposite problem of calculating the present value given a future value. The process of working \\nbackwards is called discounting. It can be used to decide how much money to invest today in \\norder to achieve a specific target sum in a few years’ time. Discounting can be used to appraise \\ndifferent investment projects. On the macroeconomic level, the relationship between interest \\nrates and speculative demand for money is investigated.\\nThe material in this chapter will be of greatest benefit to students on business studies and \\nmanagement courses.

The actual rise or fall was first worked out, and these changes were then \\napplied to the original value to obtain the final answer. It is possible to obtain this answer  \\nin a single calculation, and we now describe how this can be done. Not only is this new \\napproach quicker, but it also enables us to tackle more difficult problems. To be specific,  \\nlet us suppose that the price of a good is set to rise by 9% and that its current price is $78.  \\nThe new price consists of the original (which can be thought of as 100% of the $78) plus  \\nthe increase (which is 9% of $78).

Hence the new price is\\n1.09 × 78 = $85.02\\nOne advantage of this approach is that it is then just as easy to go backwards and work \\nout the original price from the new price.

The annual \\nrate of \\ninflation is the average percentage change in a given selection of these goods and ser\\xad\\nvices, over the previous year. Seasonal variations are taken into account, and the particular \\nbasket of goods and services is changed periodically to reflect changing patterns of household \\nexpenditure. The presence of inflation is particularly irritating when trying to interpret a time \\nseries that involves a monetary value. Inevitably, this will be influenced by inflation during \\nany year, and what is of interest is the fluctuation of a time series ‘over and above’ inflation. \\nEconomists deal with this by distinguishing between nominal and real data. \\nnominal data are \\nthe original, raw data such as those listed in tables in the previous sub \\xadsection. These are \\nbased on the prices that prevailed at the time. real data are the values that have been adjusted \\nto take inflation into account. The standard way of doing this is to pick a year and then con\\xad\\nvert the values for all other years to the level that they would have had in this base year. This \\nmay sound rather complicated, but the idea and calculations involved are really quite simple \\nas the following example demonstrates.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 225, 'page_label': '209'}, page_content='SEctiOn 3.1  PerCenTAgeS  209\\nSolution\\nThe raw figures shown in Table 3.8 give the impression that houses increased steadily in \\nvalue throughout this period, with a quite substantial gain during the first year. However, \\nif inflation had been very high, then the gain in real terms would have been quite small. \\nIndeed, if the rate of inflation were to exceed the percentage rise of these nominal data, \\nthen the price of a house would actually fall in real terms. To analyse this situation we will \\nuse Table 3.9, which shows the rates of inflation during this period. Notice that since the \\nhouse prices listed in Table 3.9 are quoted at the end of each year, we are not interested in \\nthe rate of inflation during Year 1.\\nWe are told in the question to choose Year 2 as the base year and calculate the value of \\nthe house at ‘Year 2 prices’. The value of the house at the end of Year 2 is obviously $89 000, \\nsince no adjustment needs to be made. At the end of Year 3, the house is worth $93 000.  \\nHowever, during that year, inflation was 7.1%. To adjust this price to ‘Year 2 prices’ we \\nsimply divide by the scale factor 1.071, since we are going backwards in time. We get\\n93 000\\n1.071 5 86 835\\nIn real terms the house has fallen in value by over $2000.\\nTo adjust the price of the house in Year 4 we first need to divide by 1.035 to backtrack \\nto Year 3, and then divide again by 1.071 to reach Year 2. We get\\n100 000\\n1.035 3 1.071 5 90 213\\nIn real terms there has at least been some gain during Year 4.

In this section we explain how these financial calculations are car\\xad\\nried out to enable an informed choice to be made between the various possibilities available. \\nWe begin by considering what happens when a single lump sum is invested and show how to \\ncalculate the amount accumulated over a period of time.\\nSuppose that someone gives you the option of receiving $500 now or $500 in three years’ \\ntime. Which of these alternatives would you accept? Most people would take the money now, \\npartly because they may have an immediate need for it, but also because they recognise that \\n$500 is worth more today than in three years’ time. Even if we ignore the effects of inflation, \\nit is still better to take the money now, since it can be invested and will increase in value over \\nthe three\\n\\xadyear period. In order to work out this value, we need to know the rate of interest \\nand the basis on which it is calculated. Let us begin by assuming that the $500 is invested for \\nthree years at 10% interest compounded annually. What exactly do we mean by ‘10% inter\\xad\\nest compounded annually’? Well, at the end of each year, the interest is calculated and is \\nadded on to the amount currently invested. If the original amount is $500, then after one year \\nthe interest is 10% of $500, which is\\n10\\n100\\n1\\n103 $500 5       3 $500 5 $50\\nso the amount rises by $50 to $550.\\nWhat happens to this amount at the end of the second year? Is the interest also $50? This \\nwould actually be the case with simple interest, when the amount of interest received is the \\nsame for all years. However, with compound interest, we get ‘interest on the interest’. Nearly \\nall financial investments use compound rather than simple interest, because investors need to \\nbe rewarded for not taking the interest payment out of the fund each year. Under annual \\ncompounding the interest obtained at the end of the second year is 10% of the amount \\ninvested at the start of that year. This not only consists of the original $500, but also the $50 \\nalready received as interest on the first year’s investment. Consequently, we get an additional\\n1\\n10 3 $550 5 $55'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 233, 'page_label': '217'}, page_content='SEctiOn 3.2  COMPOU nD InTereST  217\\nraising the sum to $605. Finally, at the end of the third year, the interest is\\n1\\n10 3 $605 5 $60.50\\nso the investment is $665.50. You are therefore $165.50 better off by taking the $500 now and \\ninvesting it for three years. The calculations are summarised in Table 3.22.\\ntable 3.22\\nEnd of year interest ($) investment ($)\\n1 50 550\\n2 55 605\\n3 60.50 665.50\\nThe calculations in Table 3.22 were performed by finding the interest earned each year and \\nadding it on to the amount accumulated at the beginning of the year. This approach is rather \\nlaborious, particularly if the money is invested over a long period of time. What is really \\nneeded is a method of calculating the investment after, say, 10 years without having to deter\\xad\\nmine the amount for the nine intermediate years. This can be done using the scale factor \\napproach discussed in the previous section. To illustrate this, let us return to the problem of \\ninvesting $500 at 10% interest compounded annually. The original sum of money is called \\nthe \\nprincipal and is denoted by P, and the final sum is called the future value and is denoted by \\nS.

However, a more mathematical approach is to use logarithms, because we \\nare being asked to solve an equation in which the unknown occurs as a power. Following \\nthe method described in Section 2.3, we first divide both sides by 25\\n  000 to get\\n10 = (1.12)n\\nTaking logarithms of both sides gives\\nlog(10) = log(1.12)n\\nand if you apply rule 3 of logarithms you get\\nlog(10) = n  log(1.12) logbxm 5 m logbx\\nHence\\nn 5\\n5\\nlog(10)\\nlog(1.12)\\n1\\n0.49 218 023 (taking logarithms to base 10)\\n(to one decimal place)5 20.3\\nNow we know that n must be a whole number because interest is only added on at the end \\nof each year. We assume that the first interest payment occurs exactly 12 months after the \\ninitial investment and every 12 months thereafter. The answer, 20.3, tells us that after only \\n20 years the amount is less than $250 000, so we need to wait until 21 years have elapsed \\nbefore it exceeds this amount. In fact, after 20 years\\nS = $25 000(1.12)20 = $241 157.33\\nand after 21 years\\nS = $25 000(1.12)21 = $270 096.21\\nIn this example we calculated the time taken for $25   000 to increase by a factor of 10. It \\ncan be shown that this time depends only on the interest rate and not on the actual value of \\nthe principal. To see this, note that if a general principal, P, increases tenfold, then its future \\nvalue is 10P. If the interest rate is 12%, then we need to solve\\n10P 5 P 1 1 12\\n100\\nn\\nfor n.

A firm estimates that its sales will rise by 3% each year and that it needs to sell at least \\n10  000 goods each year in order to make a profit. Given that its current annual sales \\nare only 9000, how many years will it take before the firm breaks even?\\nYou may have noticed that in all of the previous problems, it is assumed that the interest is \\ncompounded annually. It is possible for interest to be added to the investment more frequently \\nthan this. For example, suppose that a principal of $500 is invested for three years at 10% \\ninterest compounded quarterly. What do we mean by ‘10% interest compounded quarterly’? \\nWell, it does not mean that we get 10% interest every three months. Instead, the 10% is split \\ninto four equal portions, one for each quarter. Every three months the interest accrued is\\n10%\\n4 5 2.5%\\nso after the first quarter the investment gets multiplied by 1.025 to give\\n500(1.025)\\nand after the second quarter it gets multiplied by another 1.025 to give\\n500(1.025)2\\nand so on. Moreover, since there are exactly twelve 3 \\xadmonth periods in three years, we \\ndeduce that the future value is\\n500(1.025)12 = $672.44\\nNotice that this is greater than the sum obtained at the start of this section under annual \\ncompounding.\\nThis example highlights the fact that the compound interest formula\\nS 5 P r\\nn\\n1 1 100\\nderived earlier for annual compounding can also be used for other types of compounding. All \\nthat is needed is to reinterpret the symbols r and n. The variable r now represents the rate of \\ninterest per time period, and n represents the total number of periods.\\nExample\\nA principal of $10 is invested at 12% interest for one year.

This is to be expected because the basic feature of compound interest is that we get \\n‘interest on the interest’. However, one important observation that you might not have \\nexpected is that, although the future values increase, they appear to be approaching a fixed \\nvalue. It can be shown that this always occurs. The type of compounding in which the inter\\xad\\nest is added on with increasing frequency is called \\ncontinuous compounding. In theory, we can \\nfind the future value of a principal under continuous compounding using the approach taken \\nin the previous example. We work with smaller and smaller time periods until the numbers \\nsettle down to a fixed value. However, it turns out that there is a special formula that can be \\nused to compute this directly.

The bank offers a \\nreturn of 12% compounded monthly.\\n(a) Determine the total amount saved after 12 months.\\n(b) After how many months does the amount saved first exceed $2000?\\nSolution\\n(a) During the year a total of 12 regular savings of $100 are made. Each $100 is put into an \\naccount that gives a return of 12% compounded monthly, or equivalently, a return of \\n1% each month. However, each payment is invested for a different period of time. For \\nexample, the first payment is invested for the full 12 months, whereas the final payment \\nis invested for 1 month only. We need to work out the future value of each payment \\nseparately and add them together.\\nThe first payment is invested for 12 months, gaining a monthly interest of 1%, so its \\nfuture value is\\n100(1.01)12\\nThe second payment is invested for 11 months, so its future value is\\n100(1.01)11\\nLikewise, the third payment yields\\n100(1.01)10\\nand so on. The last payment is invested for 1 month, so its future value is\\n100(1.01)1\\nThe total value of the savings at the end of 12 months is then\\n100(1.01)12 + 100(1.01)11 +   .  .  .   + 100(1.01)1\\nIf we rewrite this series in the order of ascending powers, we then have the more familiar \\nform\\n100(1.01)1 +   .  .  .   + 100(1.01)11 + 100(1.01)12\\nThis is equal to the sum of the first 12 terms of a geometric progression in which the first \\nterm is \\n100(1.01) and the geometric ratio is 1.01. Its value can therefore be found by using\\na rn 2 1\\nr 2 1\\nwith a = 100(1.01), r = 1.01 and n = 12, which gives\\n$100(1.01) (1.01)12 2 1\\n1.01 2 1 5 $1280.93\\n(b) In part (a) we showed that after 12 months the total amount saved is\\n100(1.01) + 100(1.01)2 +  .  .  .  + 100(1.01)12\\nUsing exactly the same argument, it is easy to see that after n months the account contains\\n100(1.01) + 100(1.01)2 +  .  .  .  + 100(1.01)n\\n➜'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 250, 'page_label': '234'}, page_content='234  c hAPtEr 3 MATHeMATICS  OF FInAnCe\\nPractice Problem\\n3.

Many businesses finance their expansion by obtaining \\nloans from a bank or other financial institution. Banks are keen to do this provided that  \\nthey receive interest as a reward for lending money. Businesses pay back loans by monthly  \\nor annual repayments. The way in which this repayment is calculated is as follows. Let us  \\nsuppose that interest is calculated on a monthly basis and that the firm repays the debt by \\nfixed monthly instalments at the end of each month. The bank calculates the interest charged \\nduring the first month based on the original loan. At the end of the month, this interest is \\nadded on to the original loan, and the repayment is simultaneously deducted to determine  \\nthe amount owed. The bank then charges interest in the second month based on this new \\namount, and the process is repeated. Provided that the monthly repayment is greater than the \\ninterest charged each month, the amount owed decreases and, eventually, the debt is cleared. \\nIn practice, the period during which the loan is repaid is fixed in advance and the monthly \\nrepayments are calculated to achieve this end.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 251, 'page_label': '235'}, page_content='SEctiOn 3.3  g eOMeTrIC SerIeS  235\\nExample\\nDetermine the monthly repayments needed to repay a $100   000 loan which is paid back \\nover 25 years when the interest rate is 8% compounded annually.\\nSolution\\nIn this example the time interval between consecutive repayments is 1 month, whereas  \\nthe period during which interest is charged is one year. This type of financial calculation \\ntypifies the way in which certain types of housing loan are worked out.

During this \\ntime, 12 monthly repayments are made, so if each instalment is $x, the outstanding debt \\nmust decrease by 12x. Hence, at the end of the first year, the amount owed is\\n100 000 + 8000 − 12x = 108 000 − 12x\\nIn order to be able to spot a pattern in the annual debt, let us write this as\\n100 000(1.08) − 12x\\nwhere the first part simply reflects the fact that 8% interest is added on to the original sum \\nof $100\\n  000. At the end of the second year, a similar calculation is performed. The amount \\nowed rises by 8% to become\\n[100 000(1.08) − 12x](1.08) = 100 000(1.08)2 − 12x(1.08)\\nand we deduct 12x for the repayments to get\\n100 000(1.08)2 − 12x(1.08) − 12x\\nThis is the amount owed at the end of the second year. Each year we multiply by 1.08 and \\nsubtract 12x, so at the end of the third year we owe\\n [100 000(1.08)2 − 12x(1.08) − 12x] (1.08) − 12x\\n= 100 000(1.08)3 − 12x(1.08)2 − 12x(1.08) − 12x\\nand so on.

Instead, the present value \\nof each individual payment is calculated and the values are then summed longhand.\\nIn this case, \\na = 10  000(1.07)−1, r = 1.07−1 and n = 10, so the present value of the annuity is\\n$10 000(1.07)21 1.07210 2 1\\n1.0721 2 1 5 $70 235.82\\nThis represents the amount of money that needs to be invested now so that a regular annual \\nincome of $10  000 can be withdrawn from the fund for the next 10 years.\\nFor many people there is a real fear that their pension will not provide an adequate income \\nfor the whole of their retirement. If the income stream is to continue for ever, then we need \\nto investigate what happens to the formula\\na rn 2 1\\nr 2 1\\nas n gets bigger and bigger. In this case r = 1.07−1 < 1, so as n increases, rn decreases and tends \\ntowards zero. This behaviour can be seen clearly from the table:\\nn 1 10 100\\n1.07−n 0.9346 0.5083 0.0012\\nSetting rn = 0 in the formula for the sum of geometric series shows that if the series goes on \\nfor ever, then eventually the sum approaches\\na\\n1 2 r\\nso that the present value of the annuity in perpetuity is\\n10 000(1.07)21\\n1 2 1.0721 5 $142857.14\\nThis compares with the figure of $70 235.82 calculated previously to secure the income for  \\n10 years.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 264, 'page_label': '248'}, page_content='248  c hAPtEr 3 MATHeMATICS  OF FInAnCe\\nExample\\nA small business has a choice of investing $20  000 in one of two projects.

In this situation an \\ninvestor would be encouraged to buy this bond in the expectation of not only receiving the \\ncash flow from holding the bond but also receiving a capital gain on its present value. \\nSpeculative balances therefore decrease as a result of high interest rates because money is \\nconverted into securities.

There are eight \\nsections, which should be read in the order that they appear. It should be possible to omit \\nSections 4.4 and 4.7 at a first reading, and Section 4.6 can be read any time after Section 4.3.\\nSection 4.1 provides a leisurely introduction to the basic idea of differentiation. The material  \\nis explained using pictures, which will help you to understand the connection between the \\nunderlying mathematics and the economic applications in later sections.\\nThere are six rules of differentiation, which are evenly split between Sections 4.2 and 4.4. \\nSection 4.2 considers the easy rules that all students will need to know. However, if you are on \\na business studies or management course, the more advanced rules in Section 4.4 may not  \\nbe of relevance and could be ignored. As far as possible, examples given in later sections and \\nchapters are based on the easy rules only so that such students are not disadvantaged. \\nHowever, the more advanced rules are essential to any proper study of mathematical economics, \\nand their use in deriving general results is unavoidable.\\nSections 4.3 and 4.5 describe standard economic applications. Marginal functions associated  \\nwith revenue, cost, production, consumption and savings functions are all discussed in Section \\n4.3. The important topic of elasticity is described in Section 4.5. The distinction is made \\nbetween price elasticity along an arc and price elasticity at a point. Familiar results involving \\ngeneral linear demand functions and the relationship between price elasticity of demand and \\nrevenue are derived.\\nSections 4.6 and 4.7 are devoted to the topic of optimisation, which is used to find the maximum  \\nand minimum values of economic functions. In the first half of Section 4.6 we concentrate  \\non the mathematical technique. The second half contains four examination-type problems, all \\ntaken from economics and business, which are solved in detail. In Section 4.7, mathematics is \\nused to derive general results relating to the optimisation of profit and production functions. \\nA simple model of stock control in business is described and a general formula for the economic \\norder quantity derived.\\nThe final section revises two important mathematical functions, namely the exponential and \\nnatural logarithm functions. We describe how to differentiate these functions and illustrate \\ntheir use in economics and business.\\nDifferentiation is probably the most important topic in the whole text, and one that we shall  \\ncontinue in Chapters 5 and 6, since it provides the necessary background theory for much of \\nmathematical economics. You are therefore advised to make every effort to attempt the  \\nproblems given in each section. The prerequisites include an understanding of the concept of \\na function together with the ability to manipulate algebraic expressions. These are covered in \\nChapters 1 and 2, and if you have worked successfully through this material, you should find \\nthat you are in good shape to begin calculus.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 284, 'page_label': '268'}, page_content='SeCtion 4.1\\nThe derivative of a function\\nObjectives\\nAt the end of this section you should be able to:\\n●\\t Find the slope of a straight line given any two points on the line.\\n●\\t Detect whether a line is uphill, downhill or horizontal using the sign of the slope.\\n●\\t Recognise the notation f′(x) and dy/dx for the derivative of a function.\\n●\\t Estimate the derivative of a function by measuring the slope of a tangent.\\n●\\t Differentiate power functions.\\nThis introductory section is designed to get you started with differential calculus in a fairly \\npainless way. There are really only three things that we are going to do. We discuss the basic \\nidea of something called a derived function, give you two equivalent pieces of notation to \\ndescribe it, and finally show you how to write down a formula for the derived function in \\nsimple cases.\\nIn Chapter 1 the slope of a straight line was defined to be the change in the value of y \\nbrought about by a 1-unit increase in x. In fact, it is not necessary to restrict the change in x \\nto a 1-unit increase. More generally, the \\nslope, or gradient, of a line is taken to be the change \\nin y divided by the corresponding change in x as you move between any two points on the \\nline. It is customary to denote the change in y by Δy, where Δ is the Greek letter ‘delta’. \\nLikewise, the change in x is written Δx.

It is defi  ned to \\nbe  PQ , where  P  denotes the price of a good and  Q  denotes the quantity demanded. In prac-\\ntice, we usually know the demand function, which provides a relationship between  P  and  Q . \\nThis enables a formula for TR to be written down solely in terms of  Q . For example, if \\n     P  = 100 − 2 Q     \\n then \\n    TR =  PQ  = (100 − 2 Q ) Q  = 100 Q  − 2 Q  2     \\n The formula can be used to calculate the value of TR corresponding to any value of  Q . Not \\ncontent with this, we are also interested in the eff  ect on TR of a change in the value of  Q  from \\nsome existing level. To do this we introduce the concept of marginal revenue.

Marginal revenue is sometimes taken to be the change in TR brought about by a \\n1 unit increase in Q. It is easy to check that this gives an acceptable approximation to MR, \\nalthough it is not quite the same as the exact value obtained by differentiation. For example, \\nsubstituting Q\\n = 15 into the total revenue function considered previously gives\\nTR = 100(15) − 2(15)2 = 1050\\nAn increase of 1 unit in the value of Q produces a total revenue\\nTR = 100(16) − 2(16)2 = 1088\\nThis is an increase of 38, which, according to the non-calculus definition, is the value of MR \\nwhen Q is 15. This compares with the exact value of 40 obtained by differentiation.\\nIt is instructive to give a graphical interpretation of these two approaches. In Figure 4.12 \\nthe point A lies on the TR curve corresponding to a quantity Q\\n0. The exact value of MR at \\nthis point is equal to the derivative\\nd(TR)\\ndQ\\nand so is given by the slope of the tangent at A. The point B also lies on the curve but corres-\\nponds to a 1-unit increase in Q. The vertical distance from A to B therefore equals the change \\nin TR when Q increases by 1 unit.

Let us suppose that a firm’s demand curve is downward-sloping. If the firm \\nlowers the price, then it will receive less for each item, but the number of items sold increases. \\nThe formula for total revenue, TR, is\\nTR = PQ\\nand it is not immediately obvious what the net effect on TR will be as P decreases and Q \\nincreases. The crucial factor here is not the absolute changes in P and Q but rather the pro-\\nportional or percentage changes. Intuitively, we expect that if the percentage rise in Q is \\ngreater than the percentage fall in P, then the firm experiences an increase in revenue. Under \\nthese circumstances we say that demand is \\nelastic, since the demand is relatively sensitive to \\nchanges in price. Similarly, demand is said to be inelastic if demand is relatively insensitive  \\nto price changes. In this case, the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage \\nchange in price. A firm can then increase revenue by raising the price of the good. Although \\ndemand falls as a result, the increase in price more than compensates for the reduced volume \\nof sales and revenue rises. Of course, it could happen that the percentage changes in price and \\nquantity are equal, leaving revenue unchanged. We use the term \\nunit elastic to describe this \\nsituation.\\nWe quantify the responsiveness of demand to price change by defining the price elasticity \\nof demand to be\\nE 5 percentage change in demand\\npercentage change in price\\nNotice that because the demand curve slopes downwards, a positive change in price leads to \\na negative change in quantity and vice versa. Consequently, the value of E is always negative. \\nIt is usual for economists to ignore the negative sign and consider just the magnitude of elas-\\nticity. If this positive value is denoted by u E u, then the previous classification of demand func-\\ntions can be restated more succinctly as:'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 331, 'page_label': '315'}, page_content='SEctiOn 4.5 ElASTICITY  315\\n  Demand is said to be \\n   ●\\t   inelastic if u  E  u < 1  \\n  ●\\t   unit elastic if u  E  u = 1  \\n  ●\\t   elastic if u  E  u > 1    \\nDemand is said to be \\n●\\t   inelastic if u E u < 1  \\n●\\t   unit elastic if u E u = 1  \\n●\\t   elastic if u E u > 1    \\n As usual, we denote the changes in  P  and  Q  by Δ P  and Δ Q  respectively, and seek a formula \\nfor  E  in terms of these symbols. To motivate this, suppose that the price of a good is $12 and \\nthat it rises to $18. A moment’s thought should convince you that the percentage change in \\nprice is then 50%. You can probably work this out in your head without thinking too hard. \\nHowever, it is worthwhile identifying the mathematical process involved.

Observe that if −1 < \\nE < 0 then 1/E < −1, so MR \\nis negative for any value of P. It follows that the revenue function is decreasing in regions \\nwhere demand is inelastic, because MR determines the slope of the revenue curve.

Provided that the quadratic equation has at least \\none solution, it is then possible to deduce the coordinates of the maximum or minimum point \\nof the parabola. For example, if there are two solutions, then by symmetry the graph turns \\nround at the point exactly halfway between these solutions. Unfortunately, if the quadratic \\nequation has no solution, then only a limited sketch can be obtained using this approach.\\nIn this section we show how the techniques of calculus can be used to find the coordinates  \\nof the turning point of a parabola. The beauty of this approach is that it can be used to locate \\nthe maximum and minimum points of any economic function, not just those represented by \\nquadratics. Look at the graph in Figure 4.21. Points B, C, D, E, F and G are referred to as the \\nstationary points (sometimes called critical points, turning points or extrema) of the function.  \\nAt a stationary point the tangent to the graph is horizontal, and so has zero slope.\\nConsequently, at a stationary point of a function f (x),\\nf ′(x) = 0\\nThe reason for using the word ‘stationary’ is historical. Calculus was originally used by \\nastron\\n omers to predict planetary motion. If a graph of the distance travelled by an object is \\nsketched against time, then the speed of the object is given by the slope, since this represents \\nthe rate of change of distance with respect to time. It follows that if the graph is horizontal \\nat some point, then the speed is zero and the object is instantaneously at rest: that is, stationary.\\nStationary points are classified into one of three types: local maxima, local minima and  \\nstationary points of inflection.\\nAt a \\nlocal maximum  (sometimes called a relative maximum), the graph falls away on  \\nboth sides.

Again, it is not necessary for the global \\nminimum to be one of the local minima. In Figure 4.21 the lowest point on the graph occurs \\nat the left-hand end, A, which is not a stationary point.\\nAt a \\nstationary point of inflection , the graph rises on one side and falls on the other. The \\nstationary points of inflection in Figure 4.21 are labelled D and F. These points are of little \\nvalue in economics, although they do sometimes assist in sketching graphs of economic func-\\ntions. Maxima and minima, on the other hand, are important. The calculation of the max\\n-\\nimum points of the revenue and profit functions is clearly worthwhile. Likewise, it is useful \\nto be able to find the minimum points of average cost functions.\\nFor most examples in economics, the local maximum and minimum points coincide with the \\nglobal maximum and minimum. For this reason we shall drop the word ‘local’ when describing \\nstationary points. However, always bear in mind that the global maximum and minimum \\ncould actually be attained at an end point and this possibility may need to be checked. This \\ncan be done by comparing the function values at the end points with those of the stationary \\npoints and then deciding which of them gives rise to the largest or smallest values.\\nTwo obvious questions remain. How do we find the stationary points of any given func-\\ntion, and how do we classify them? The first question is easily answered. As we mentioned \\nearlier, stationary points satisfy the equation\\nf ′(x) = 0\\nso all we need is to differentiate the function, to equate to zero and to solve the resulting \\nalgebraic equation. The classification is equally straightforward. It can be shown that if a \\nfunction has a stationary point at \\nx = a, then\\n●\\t if f ″(a) > 0, then f(x) has a minimum at x = a;\\n●\\t if f ″(a) < 0, then f(x) has a maximum at x = a.\\nTherefore, we need only to differentiate the function a second time and to evaluate this \\nsecond-\\n order derivative at each point. A point is a minimum if this value is positive and a \\nmaximum if this value is negative.

The new supply equation is then\\nP − t = QS + 8\\nso that\\nP = QS + 8 + t\\nIn equilibrium\\nQS = QD\\nIf this common value is denoted by Q, then the supply and demand equations become\\nP = Q + 8 + t\\nP = −3Q + 80\\nHence\\nQ + 8 + t = −3Q + 80\\nsince both sides are equal to P.

A furniture manufacturer has to \\nobtain wood and other raw materials to make its goods, and a grocery store needs to have a \\nregular supply of frozen food to store in its freezers. Management needs to make decisions \\nabout when to order more stock and the size of each order. Let us suppose that the annual \\ndemand is D items and that the firm orders Q of these at regular intervals during the year. \\nFor example, if the demand is 12\\n  000, the firm might place an order for 1000 items each \\nmonth. Alternatively, the firm could increase the order size to 3000 items and thereby reduce \\nthe number of orders to just \\n12  000/3000 = 4  times a year. In general, orders are made D/Q \\ntimes a year.\\nThere are many costs incurred in inventory control (including opportunity costs), but  \\nwe shall consider just two: ordering costs and holding costs.

This includes the cost of storage, \\ninsurance and interest lost on the capital used to buy these goods waiting to be sold. In the \\nsimplest model we will assume that the level of stock falls at a constant rate throughout the \\nyear and that the firm waits until the stock levels are zero before reordering. If we further \\nassume that the stock is replenished instantly, then the variation of stock levels during the \\ncourse of a year would be modelled by the pattern shown in Figure 4.28. In practice this  \\nmay not occur. There are likely to be seasonal variations in demand, so the gradients of each \\nsection of the graph may vary from one cycle to the next, and demand may not even be linear. \\nAlso, it is not good practice to wait until shelves are empty before reordering stock and, since \\ngoods do not arrive instantly, firms build in a lead time to allow for this. However, as a first \\nmodel of the real situation, we will assume that stock levels follow the pattern shown in \\nFigure 4.28.\\nIn each period the average number of items stored is Q/2, and, since this pattern is  \\nreplicated throughout the year, the average number of items held in store each year is Q/2.

On the other hand, to minimise \\nholding costs you want to make Q as small as possible.

This can also be seen from \\nthe definition,\\nDy\\nDxDx\\nf 9(x) 5 lim\\n0\\nAs Δx S 0 through positive values (i.e. from the right) the limit is +1, whereas as Δx S 0 \\nthrough negative values (i.e. from the left) the limit is −1.

In many ways this chapter can be regarded as the climax of the whole \\ntext. It is the summit of the mathematical mountain that we have been merrily climbing. Not  \\nonly are the associated mathematical ideas and techniques quite sophisticated, but also partial \\ndifferentiation provides a rich source of applications. In one sense there is no new material \\npresented here. If you know how to differentiate a function of one variable, then you also know \\nhow to partially differentiate a function of several variables because the rules are the same. \\nSimilarly, if you can optimise a function of one variable, then you need have no fear of uncon-\\nstrained and constrained optimisation. Of course, if you cannot use the elementary rules of \\ndifferentiation or cannot find the maximum and minimum values of a function as described in \\nChapter 4, then you really are fighting a lost cause. Under these circumstances, you are best \\nadvised to omit this chapter entirely. There is no harm in doing this, because it does not form \\nthe prerequisite for any of the later topics. However, you will miss out on one of the most ele-\\ngant and useful branches of mathematics.\\nIt is important that Sections 5.1 and 5.2 are read first, but the remaining four sections can be \\nstudied in any order. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 follow the familiar pattern. We begin by looking at the \\nmathematical techniques and then use them to determine marginal functions and elasticities. \\nSection 5.3 describes the multiplier concept and completes the topic of national income deter-\\nmination which you studied in Chapter 1.\\nThe final three sections are devoted to optimisation. For functions of several variables, optimisation \\nproblems are split into two groups, unconstrained and constrained. Unconstrained problems, \\ntackled in Section 5.4, involve the maximisation and minimisation of functions in which the variables \\nare free to take any values whatsoever.

To \\nanalyse general economic behaviour, we must extend the concept of a function, and particu-\\nlarly the differential calculus, to functions of several variables.\\nA \\nfunction, f, of two variables is a rule that assigns to each incoming pair of numbers, (x, y), \\na uniquely defined outgoing number, z. This is illustrated in Figure 5.1. The ‘black box’ f  \\nperforms some arithmetic operation on x and y to produce z.

The answer is yes in the case of functions of two variables, although it is \\nnot particularly easy to construct. A function\\nz = f(x, y)\\ncan be thought of as a surface, rather like a mountain range, in three-dimensional space as \\nshown in Figure 5.3. If you visualise the incoming point with coordinates \\n(x, y) as lying in  \\na horizontal plane, then the height of the surface, z, directly above it represents the value of \\nthe function at this point. As you can probably imagine, it is not an easy task to sketch the \\nsurface by hand from an equation such as\\nf(x, y) = xy3 + 4x\\nalthough three-dimensional graphics packages are available for most computers which can \\nproduce such a plot.\\nIt is impossible to provide any sort of graphical interpretation for functions of more than \\ntwo variables. For example, a function of, say, four variables would require five dimensions, \\none for each of the incoming variables and a further one for the outgoing variable! In spite of \\nthis setback we can still perform the task of differentiating functions of several variables and, \\nas we shall see in the remaining sections of this chapter, such derivatives play a vital role in \\nanalysing economic behaviour.\\nGiven a function of two variables,\\nz = f(x, y)\\nwe can determine two first-order derivatives. The partial derivative of f with respect to x is  \\nwritten as\\n−z\\n−x\\n−f\\n−xor or fx\\nand is found by differentiating f with respect to x, with y held constant.

Unfortunately, it is not so easy to identify the \\nmotivation for their behaviour. One tentative suggestion is that consumers try to maximise \\nearned income. However, if this were the case, then individuals would try to work 24 hours \\na day for seven days a week, which is not so. In practice, people like to allocate a reasonable \\nproportion of time to leisure activities.\\nConsumers are faced with a choice of how many hours each week to spend working and \\nhow many to devote to leisure. In the same way, a consumer needs to decide how many items \\nof various goods to buy and has a preference between the options available. To analyse the \\nbehaviour of consumers quantitatively, we associate with each set of options a number, U, \\ncalled \\nutility, which indicates the level of satisfaction. Suppose that there are two goods, G1 \\nand G2, and that the consumer buys x1 items of G1 and x2 items of G2. The variable U is then \\na function of x1 and x2, which we write as\\nU = U(x1, x2)\\nIf\\nU(3, 7) = 20 and U(4, 5) = 25\\nfor example, then the consumer derives greater satisfaction from buying four items of G1 and \\nfive items of G2 than from buying three items of G1 and seven items of G2.\\nUtility is a function of two variables, so we can work out two first-order partial derivatives,\\n−U\\n−x1\\n−U\\n−x2\\nand\\nThe derivative\\n−U\\n−xi\\ngives the rate of change of U with respect to x i and is called the marginal utility of xi.

In \\nother words, as the consumption of good G1 increases, each additional item of G1 bought \\nconfers less utility than the previous item. A similar property holds for G2. This is known as \\nthe \\nlaw of diminishing marginal utility.\\nadvice\\nYou might like to compare this with the law of diminishing marginal productivity discussed in  \\nSection 4.3.2.\\nIt was pointed out in Section 5.1 that functions of two variables could be represented by \\nsurfaces in three dimensions. This is all very well in theory, but in practice the task of sketching \\nsuch a surface by hand is virtually impossible. This difficulty has been faced by geographers \\nfor years, and the way they circumvent the problem is to produce a two-dimensional contour \\nmap. A contour is a curve joining all points at the same height above sea level. Exactly the \\nsame device can be used for utility functions. Rather than attempt to sketch the surface, we \\ndraw an \\nindifference map. This consists of indifference curves joining points (x1, x2) which give \\nthe same value of utility. Mathematically, an indifference curve is defined by an equation\\nU(x1, x2) = U0\\nfor some fixed value of U0. A typical indifference map is sketched in Figure 5.4.\\nPoints A and B both lie on the lower indifference curve, U0 = 20.

Both of these combina-\\ntions yield the same level of satisfaction and the consumer is indifferent to choosing between \\nthem. In symbols we have\\nU(a1, a2) = 20 and U(b1, b2) = 20\\nPoints C and D lie on indifference curves that are further away from the origin. The combina-\\ntions of goods that these points represent yield higher levels of utility and so are ranked above \\nthose of A and B.\\nIndifference curves are usually downward-sloping. If fewer purchases are made of G1, then  \\nthe consumer has to compensate for this by buying more of type G2 to maintain the same \\nlevel of satisfaction. Note also from Figure 5.4 that the slope of an indifference curve varies \\nalong its length, taking large negative values close to the vertical axis and becoming almost \\nzero as the curve approaches the horizontal axis. Again, this is to be expected for any func-\\ntion that obeys the law of diminishing marginal utility. A consumer who currently owns a \\nlarge number of items of G2 and relatively few of G1 is likely to value G1 more highly. \\nConsequently, he or she might be satisfied in sacrificing a large number of items of G2 to gain \\njust one or two extra items of G1. In this region the marginal utility of x\\n1 is much greater than \\nthat of x2, which accounts for the steepness of the curve close to the vertical axis. Similarly, as \\nthe curve approaches the horizontal axis, the situation is reversed and the curve flattens off. \\nWe quantify this exchange of goods by introducing the \\nmarginal rate of commodity substitution, \\nMRCS. This is defined to be the increase in x2 necessary to maintain a constant value of utility \\nwhen x1 decreases by 1 unit. This is illustrated in Figure 5.5.\\nStarting at point E, we move 1 unit to the left. The value of MRCS is then the vertical dis-\\ntance that we need to travel if we are to remain on the indifference curve passing through E. \\nNow this sort of ‘1-unit change’ definition is precisely the approach that we took in Section\\xa04.3 \\nwhen discussing marginal functions.

In Greek ‘iso’ means ‘equal’, so \\nthe word ‘isoquant’ literally translates as ‘equal quantity’. Points on an isoquant represent \\nall possible combinations of inputs ( K ,  L ) which produce a constant level of output,  Q  0 . A \\ntypical isoquant map is sketched in  Figure   5.6   . Notice that we have adopted the standard \\nconvention of plotting labour on the horizontal axis and capital on the vertical axis. \\n  The lower curve determines the input pairs needed to output 100 units. Higher levels of \\noutput correspond to isoquants further away from the origin. Again, the general shape of the \\ncurves is to be expected. For example, as capital is reduced, it is necessary to increase labour \\nto compensate and so maintain production levels.

The parameter a is  \\nthe marginal propensity to consume and lies in the range 0 < a < 1 . The parameter b is the \\nautonomous consumption and satisfies b > 0. In equilibrium\\nY = C + I (2)\\nwhere I denotes investment, which is assumed to be given by\\nI = I* (3)\\nfor some constant I *. Equations (1), (2) and (3) describe the structure of the model and as \\nsuch are called structural equations. Substituting equations (1) and (3) into equation (2) gives\\n Y = aY + b + I*\\nY − aY = b + I* (subtract aY from both sides)\\n(1 − a)Y = b + I* (take out a common factor of Y )\\nY 5 b 1 I*\\n1 2 a (divide/uni00A0both/uni00A0sides/uni00A0by/uni00A01 2 a)'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 437, 'page_label': '421'}, page_content='Secti On 5.3  COmPArATIve STATICS  421\\nThis is known as the reduced form because it compresses the model into a single equation  \\nin which the endogenous variable, Y, is expressed in terms of the exogenous variable, I*, and \\nparameters, a and b. The process of analysing the equilibrium level of income in this way is \\nreferred to as statics because it assumes that the equilibrium state is attained instantaneously. \\nThe branch of mathematical economics which investigates time dependence is known as \\ndynamics and is considered in Chapter 9.\\nWe should like to do rather more than just to calculate the equilibrium values here. In  \\nparticular, we are interested in the effect on the endogenous variables in a model brought \\nabout by changes in the exogenous variables and parameters. This is known as comparative \\nstatics, since we seek to compare the effects obtained by varying each variable and parameter \\nin turn. The actual mechanism for change will be ignored, and it will be assumed that the \\nsystem returns to equilibrium instantaneously. The equation\\nY 5 b 1 I*\\n1 2 a\\nshows that Y is a function of three variables, a, b and I*, so we can write down three partial \\nderivatives\\n−Y\\n−a\\n−Y\\n−b\\n−Y\\n−I*,,\\nThe only hard one to work out is the first, and this is found using the chain rule by writing\\nY = (b + I*)(1 − a)−1\\nwhich gives\\n−Y\\n−a 5 (b 1 I*)(21)(1 2 a)22(21) 5 b 1 I*\\n(1 2 a)2\\nTo interpret this derivative let us suppose that the marginal propensity to consume, a, \\nchanges by Δa with b and I* held constant. The corresponding change in Y is given by\\nDY 5 −Y\\n−aDa\\nStrictly speaking, the ‘=’ sign should really be ‘≅’. However, as we have seen in the previous  \\ntwo sections, provided that Δa is small, the approximation is reasonably accurate. In any case,  \\nwe could argue that the model itself is only a first approximation to what is really happening  \\nin the economy and so any further small inaccuracies that are introduced are unlikely to have \\nany significant effect on our conclusions. The above equation shows that the change in \\nnational income is found by multiplying the change in the marginal propensity to consume \\nby the partial derivative \\n∂Y/∂a. For this reason, the partial derivative is called the marginal \\npropensity to consume multiplier  for Y. In the same way, ∂Y/∂b and ∂Y/∂I* are called the \\nautonomous consumption multiplier and the investment multiplier, respectively.\\nMultipliers enable us to explain the behaviour of the model both qualitatively and quan-\\ntitatively. The qualitative behaviour can be described simply by inspecting the multipliers  \\nas they stand, before any numerical values are assigned to the variables and parameters. It is \\nusually possible to state whether the multipliers are positive or negative and hence whether  \\nan increase in an exogenous variable or parameter leads to an increase or decrease in the  \\ncorresponding endogenous variable. In the present model it is apparent that the marginal  \\npropensity to consume multiplier for Y is positive because it is known that b and I * are both \\npositive, and the denominator \\n(1 − a)2 is clearly positive.

We first write down expressions for the \\nfirst-order partial derivatives and then equate to zero. This represents a system of two equations \\nfor the two unknowns x and y, which we hope can be solved. Stationary points obtained in this \\nway can be classified into one of three types: \\nminimum point, maximum point and saddle point.\\nFigure 5.9(a) shows the shape of a surface in the neighbourhood of a minimum. It can be \\nthought of as the bottom of a bowl-shaped valley. If you stand at the minimum point and walk \\nin any direction, then you are certain to start moving upwards. Mathematically, we can classify \\na stationary point (a, b) as a minimum provided that all three of the following conditions hold:\\n−2z −2z −2z −2z −2z\\n−x2 −x2−y2 −y2 −x−y . 0\\n2\\n. 0, . 0, 2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 451, 'page_label': '435'}, page_content='Secti On 5.4  UNCONST rAINeD OPTImISATION  435\\nwhen x = a and y = b: that is,\\nfxx(a, b) > 0,  fyy(a, b) > 0,  fxx(a, b) fyy(a, b) − [ fxy(a, b)]2 > 0\\nThis triple requirement is obviously more complicated than the single condition needed in the \\ncase of a function of one variable.

In other words, the slope of the isocost line is the same as that of the isoquant at A.\\nNow we have already shown that the isocost line has slope –P\\nL/PK.

Obviously, \\nthe consumer’s equilibrium will be affected if there is a change in external conditions such  \\nas income or the price of any good.

Whilst this tells you exactly what to do to work it out, it is \\nvery imprecise and gives no real geometrical insight into what it represents.\\nLook carefully at the surface, z = f(x, y) shown in Figure 5.11. Underneath the surface in \\nthe (x, y)-plane is the line, y = b, and the point (a, b) which lies on this line. V ertically above  \\nthis line, etched on the surface itself, is a curve.

This is far \\nfrom the truth. In this chapter and the next, we look at two refreshingly different branches of \\nmathematics. It would be useful for you to have studied Chapter 1, although even this is not essen\\xad\\ntial. There are three sections which need to be read in order.\\nSection 7.1 introduces the concept of a matrix, which is a convenient mathematical way of repre\\xad\\nsenting information displayed in a table. By defining the matrix operations of addition, subtraction \\nand multiplication, it is possible to develop an algebra of matrices. Simple economic examples \\nare used to illustrate these definitions, and it is shown that the rules of matrix manipulation are \\nalmost identical to those of ordinary arithmetic. In Section 7.2 you are shown how to calculate \\nthe inverse of a matrix. This is analogous to the reciprocal of a number and enables matrix equa\\xad\\ntions to be solved. In particular, inverses provide an alternative way of solving systems of simul\\xad\\ntaneous linear equations and so can be used to solve problems in statics. Section 7.3 describes \\nCramer’s rule for solving systems of linear equations. This method is a particularly useful way of \\nsolving economic models where only a selection of endogenous variables need to be determined.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 540, 'page_label': '524'}, page_content='SeCtion 7.1\\nBasic matrix operations\\nObjectives\\nAt the end of this section you should be able to:\\n●\\t Understand the notation and terminology of matrix algebra.\\n●\\t Find the transpose of a matrix.\\n●\\t Add and subtract matrices.\\n●\\t Multiply a matrix by a scalar.\\n●\\t Multiply matrices together.\\n●\\t Represent a system of linear equations in matrix notation.\\nSuppose that a firm produces three types of good, G1, G2 and G3, which it sells to two cus\\xad\\ntomers, C1 and C2. The monthly sales for these goods are given in Table 7.1.\\nDuring the month the firm sells 3 items of G2 to customer C1, 6 items of G3 to customer \\nC2, and so on.

Quite generally, any rectangular array of numbers surrounded \\nby a pair of brackets is called a \\nmatrix (plural matrices), and the individual numbers constituting \\nthe array are called entries or elements. In this text we use square brackets, although it is \\nequally correct to use parentheses (that is, round brackets) instead. It helps to think of a matrix \\nas being made up of rows and columns. The matrix A has two rows and three columns and \\nis said to have order \\n2 × 3. In general, a matrix of order m × n has m rows and n columns.\\nWe denote matrices by capital letters in bold type (that is, A, B, C,  .  .  .  ) and their elements \\nby the corresponding lower\\xadcase letter in ordinary type. In fact, we use a rather clever double \\nsubscript notation so that aij stands for the element of A which occurs in row i and column j. \\nReferring to the matrix A above, we see that\\na12 = 3  (row 1 and column 2 of A)\\nand a23 = 6 (row 2 and column 3 of A)\\nTable 7.1\\nMonthly sales for goods\\nG1 G2 G3\\nSold to C1 7 3 4\\ncustomer C2 1 5 6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 541, 'page_label': '525'}, page_content='SeCTiOn 7.1  BASIC MATRI x ope RATIonS  525\\nA general matrix D of order 3 × 2 would be written\\ndd\\n11 12\\n21\\ndd\\ndd\\n22\\n31 32\\nSimilarly, a 3 × 3 matrix labelled E would be written\\nee e\\nee e\\nee e\\n11 12 13\\n21 22 23\\n31 32 33\\nPractice Problem\\n1.

To do this we describe several mathematical operations that \\ncan be performed on matrices, namely:\\n●\\t transposition;\\n●\\t addition and subtraction;\\n●\\t scalar multiplication;\\n●\\t matrix multiplication.\\nOne obvious omission from the list is matrix division.

It is standard practice to identify vectors using lower \\xadcase rather \\nthan upper\\xadcase letters. In books they are set in bold type.

Incidentally, it is actually quite expensive to print column vectors \\nin books and journals since it is wasteful on space, particularly if the number of elements is \\nlarge.

In this case the coefficient matrix has order 4 × 4 and \\nso has 16 elements. Corresponding to each of these elements is a cofactor.

However, given that there are 16 cofactors to be calculated,  \\neven the most enthusiastic student is likely to view the prospect with some trepidation. To  \\nmake matters worse, it frequently happens in economics that only a few of the variables x i \\nare actually needed.

We actually intend to describe two \\nslightly different methods of solution. One of these is fairly sophisticated and difficult to use, \\nwhile the other is more straightforward. The justification for bothering with the ‘harder’ \\nmethod is that it provides the motivation for the ‘easier’ method. It also helps us to handle \\none or two trickier problems that sometimes arise. We shall introduce both methods by con-\\ncentrating on a specific example:\\nSolve the linear programming problem:\\nMinimise −2x + y\\nsubject to the constraints\\nx  + 2y ≤ 12\\n−x + y ≤ 3\\n x ≥ 0\\n y ≥ 0\\nIn general, three ingredients make up a linear programming problem.

Such an expression is called an objective function. \\nIn this example, a = −2, b = 1 and the problem is one of minimisation. Finally, the unknowns \\nx and y are subject to a collection of linear inequalities. Quite often (but not always) two of \\nthe inequalities are x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. These are referred to as non-negativity constraints. In this \\nexample there are a total of four constraints including the non-negativity constraints.\\nGeometrically, points (x, y) which satisfy simultaneous linear inequalities define a feasible \\nregion in the coordinate plane. In fact, for this particular problem, the feasible region has \\nalready been sketched in Figure 8.7.\\nThe problem now is to try to identify that point inside the feasible region which minimises \\nthe value of the objective function. One naïve way of doing this might be to use trial and error: \\nthat is, we could evaluate the objective function at every point within the region and choose \\nthe point which produces the smallest value. For instance, (1, 1) lies in the region, and when \\nthe values \\nx = 1 and y = 1 are substituted into\\n−2x + y\\nwe get\\n−2(1) + 1 = −1\\nSimilarly we might try (3.4, 2.1), which produces\\n−2(3.4) + 2.1 = −4.7\\nwhich is an improvement, since −4.7 < −1.\\nThe drawback of this approach is that there are infinitely many points inside the region, so \\nit is going to take a very long time before we can be certain of the solution! A more systematic \\napproach is to superimpose, on top of the feasible region, the family of straight lines,\\n−2x + y = c\\nfor various values of the constant c. Looking back at the objective function, you will notice \\nthat the number c is precisely the thing that we want to minimise. That such an equation \\nrepresents a straight line should come as no surprise to you by now. Indeed, we know from \\nthe rearrangement\\ny = 2x + c\\nthat the line has a slope of 2 with a y intercept of c. Consequently, all of these lines are parallel \\nto each other, their precise location being determined from the number c.\\nNow, when y = 0, the equation reads\\n0 = 2x + c\\nand so has solution x = −c/2. Hence the line passes through the point (−c/2, 0). A selection \\nof lines is sketched in Figure 8.8 for values of c in the range 0 to −24. These have been \\nsketched using the information that they pass through \\n(−c/2, 0)  and have a slope of 2.  \\nNote that as c decreases from 0 to −24, the lines sweep across the feasible region from left to \\nright. Also, once c goes below −24, the lines no longer intersect this region. The minimum \\nvalue of c (which, you may remember, is just the value of the objective function) is therefore \\n−24. Moreover, when \\nc = −24, the line\\n−2x + y = c\\nintersects the feasible region in exactly one point, namely (12, 0). This, then, must be the  \\nsolution of our problem. The point (12, 0) lies in the feasible region as required and because \\nit also lies on the line\\n−2x + y = −24'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 610, 'page_label': '594'}, page_content='594  c hApter 8  LIneAr Pro GrAmmInG\\npractice problem\\n3.

This is misleading, since linear programming \\nproblems do arise from concrete situations.\\nIn fact, linear programming is a vital tool for business managers who need to allocate finite \\nresources such as labour, machine time or raw materials to maximise profits or minimise \\ncosts. The word ‘programming’ is used in the sense of scheduling or management planning. \\nIn this section we develop an important skill that can loosely be called problem formulation. \\nHere we start with information, perhaps only vaguely given in words, and try to express it \\nusing the more precise language of mathematics. If the linear programming problem involves \\njust two variables we can then use the graphical technique described in Section 8.1 to solve \\nit. In the real world a problem could involve many more variables. Under these circumstances \\nwe would use a specialist computer package based on the simplex method to solve it. \\nHowever, in order to describe problem formulation, we begin with an example involving just \\ntwo variables.\\nA craft studio makes glass bowls and plates, and it can sell all of the products that it makes \\neach week. Glassware is made in two stages. In the first stage molten glass is taken from a \\nfurnace and placed at the end of a blowpipe. Skilled glassblowers then mould the glass into \\nthe desired shape. During the second stage the glass is allowed to cool in a controlled way \\ninside a second furnace (called an annealer) which helps to reduce stress and prevent the glass \\nfrom cracking. The studio employs two glassblowers who each work a 35-hour week, and \\nthe total time available each week for annealing is 130 hours. The main raw material used in \\nglassmaking is silica sand, and the studio orders 45 kg each week. A glass bowl and plate each \\nrequire 1 kg of sand. It takes a glassblower two hours to make a bowl and one hour to make \\na plate. The time needed to cool a bowl in an annealer is four hours and a plate requires one \\nhour. The profit made from selling a bowl and a plate is $150 and $100, respectively. Of \\ncourse, if there were no restrictions on either time or materials, the studio would be able to \\nmaximise weekly profit by making only glass bowls. However, with limited resources, we use \\nlinear programming to decide on the best combination.\\nSeCtion 8.2\\nApplications of linear programming\\nObjectives\\nAt the end of this section you should be able to:\\n●\\t Identify the decision variables in a linear programming problem.\\n●\\t Find an expression for the objective function and decide whether it should be maximised or \\nminimised.\\n●\\t Write down all of the constraints in the problem specification.\\n●\\t Solve linear programming problems expressed in words, remembering to confirm that the answer \\nmakes sense.\\n●\\t Work out and interpret shadow prices.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'HELIOS pdfcat', 'creationdate': '2018-01-12T11:50:30+05:30', 'author': 'Jacques, Ian;', 'moddate': '2018-01-16T17:41:02+05:30', 'title': 'Mathematics for Economics and Business', 'ebx_publisher': 'Pearson Education Limited', 'source': 'Mathematics_for_Economics.pdf', 'total_pages': 756, 'page': 621, 'page_label': '605'}, page_content='Secti On 8.2  APPLICATI onS oF LIneAr ProGrAmmInG  605\\nAs mentioned in Section 8.1, there are three things constituting a linear programming \\nproblem: unknowns, an objective function which needs maximising or minimising, and some \\nconstraints. We consider each of these in turn.\\nThe studio needs to decide how many bowls and plates to make each week. These are \\ntherefore the unknowns (called the decision variables) of this problem, and we denote these by \\nthe letters, x and y: that is, we let\\n●\\t x = number of bowls\\n●\\t y = number of plates\\nThe object is to maximise profit, so we need to find an expression for this in terms of x and \\ny.

An electronics firm decides to launch two models of a tablet, TAB1 and TAB2. The cost \\nof making each device of type TAB1 is $120 and the cost for TAB2 is $160. The firm \\nrecognises that this is a risky venture, so it decides to limit the total weekly production \\ncosts to $4000. Also, due to a shortage of skilled labour, the total number of tablets \\nthat the firm can produce in a week is at most 30. The profit made on each device is \\n$600 for TAB1 and $700 for TAB2. How should the firm arrange production to max-\\nimise profit?\\nOne important task when planning business projects is to decide whether it is worthwhile \\nbuying in extra resources. For the glassmaking problem the studio might consider the option \\nof increasing the number of hours available for glassblowing or annealing. It might also \\ninvestigate what happens to the maximum profit if it buys an extra kilogram of sand. Do \\nthese changes make any difference to the number of bowls and plates that the studio should \\nmake to maximise profit? These questions can be answered by reworking the problem chang-\\ning one constraint at a time. Most software packages provide this information automatically \\nso that management can see at a glance how sensitive the optimal solution is to small changes \\nin resources.\\nTo illustrate this idea let us consider the case when one of the glassblowers works for an \\nextra hour a week but all other resources are unchanged. The only difference to the problem \\nspecification is that the glassblowing constraint changes from\\n2x + y ≤ 70 to 2x + y ≤ 71\\nAll that happens is that the line joining (0, 70) and (35, 0) moves to a line joining (0, 71) and \\n(35.5, 0). The feasible region is barely altered, so the optimal point will still be at the intersec-\\ntion of the lines representing the boundaries of the glassblowing and sand constraints. Rather \\nthan attempt to draw these accurately on a diagram, it is easier to find the new point by solv-\\ning the simultaneous equations\\n x + y = 45\\n2x + y = 71\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives x = 26.

The shadow price \\nrepresents the maximum premium that a firm would be willing to pay for 1 extra unit of that \\nresource. The studio will welcome the extra hour of glassblowing provided it costs less than \\n$50 to provide it. In this example the shadow price of annealing is obviously zero because we \\nalready know that 10 hours of annealing time is unused, so providing an extra hour for this \\nwould have no impact on the overall profit.

So far, all of \\nour models have been static. We have implicitly assumed that equilibrium prices and incomes are \\nsomehow attained instantaneously, as if by magic. In practice, economic variables take time to \\nvary. The incorporation of time into economic models is known as \\ndynamics, and it enables us  \\nto decide whether equilibrium values are actually achieved and, if so, exactly how individual  \\nvariables approach these values. There are two sections that can be read in either order.\\nIn Section 9.1 we consider the case when time, t, is a discrete variable taking whole number \\nvalues. This describes the situation in which variables change only after fixed periods. For \\nexample, the prices of certain agricultural products change from one season to the next but are \\nfixed throughout each season. We express this time dependence using an obvious subscript \\nnotation. The price during the first period is denoted by P\\n1, the price during the second period \\nis P2 and so on. Equations that relate the price in one period, Pt, to that of the previous period, \\nPt−1, are called difference equations, and a method is described for the solution of such  \\nequations.\\nIn Section 9.2 we consider the case when time is a continuous variable taking all possible values \\nin a certain interval. This describes the situation in which variables change from one moment to \\nthe next. For example, the prices of certain commodities, such as oil, effectively change instantane\\xad\\nously and are not fixed on a seasonal basis. We express this time dependence using the usual \\nfunction notation, P(t). It is appropriate to model the rate of change of P with respect to t using \\nthe derivative, P′(t). Equations that involve the derivatives of an unknown function are called  \\ndifferential equations, and a method is described for solving such equations.\\nIt is not possible in an introductory text such as this to give you more than a flavour of the \\nmathematics of dynamics. However, in spite of this, we show you how to solve dynamic systems \\nin both macroeconomics and microeconomics.

If we assume that the supply and demand functions are both linear, then we \\nhave the relations\\n QS = aP − b\\nQD = −cP + d\\nfor some positive constants, a, b, c and d.

In writing down these equations, we are  \\nimplicitly assuming that only one time period is involved, that supply and demand are \\ndependent only on the price in this time period and that equilibrium values are attained \\ninstantaneously. However, for certain goods, there is a time lag between supply and price. \\nFor example, a farmer needs to decide precisely how much of any crop to sow well in advance \\nof the time of sale. This decision is made on the basis of the price at the time of planting and \\nnot on the price prevailing at harvest time, which is unknown. In other words, the supply, \\nQ\\nSt, in period t depends on the price, P t−1, in the preceding period t − 1. The corresponding \\ntime-dependent supply and demand equations are\\n QSt = aPt−1 − b\\nQDt = −cPt + d\\nIf we assume that, within each time period, demand and supply are equal, so that all goods \\nare sold, then\\nQDt = QSt\\nthat is,\\n−cPt + d = aPt−1 − b\\nThis equation can be rearranged as\\n−cPt = aPt−1 − b − d (subtract d from both sides)\\nPt 5 a\\nc Pt21 1 b 1 d\\nc2  (divide both sides by − c)\\nwhich is a difference equation of the standard form.

Moreover,\\n●\\t if a > c, then −a/c < −1 and Pt diverges\\n●\\t if a < c, then −1 < −a/c < 0 and Pt converges.\\nWe conclude that stability depends on the relative sizes of a and c, which govern the slopes \\nof the supply and demand curves. Bearing in mind that we have chosen to consider supply \\nand demand equations in which Q is expressed in terms of P, namely\\n QS = aP − b\\nQD = −cP + d\\nwe deduce that the system is stable whenever the supply curve is flatter than the demand \\ncurve when P is plotted on the horizontal axis.\\nThroughout this section we have concentrated on linear models. An obvious question to \\nask is whether we can extend these to cover the case of non-linear relationships. Unfortunately, \\nthe associated mathematics gets hard very quickly, even for mildly non-linear problems. It is \\nusually impossible to find an explicit formula for the solution of such difference equations. \\nUnder these circumstances, we fall back on the tried and trusted approach of actually calcu-\\nlating the first few values until we can identify its behaviour.

This makes sense because\\n●\\t if QD > QS, it gives dP/dt > 0, and so P increases in order to achieve a balance between sup-\\nply and demand;\\n●\\t if QS = QD, it gives dP/dt = 0, and so P is held constant at the equilibrium level;\\n●\\t if QD < Q S, it gives dP/dt < 0 , and so P decreases in order to achieve a balance between  \\nsupply and demand.\\nSubstituting equations (1) and (2) into equation (3) gives\\ndP\\ndt 5 a[(2cP 1 d) 2 (aP 2 b)] 5 2a(a 1 c)P 1 a(d 1 b)\\nwhich is a differential equation of the standard form.\\nPractice Problem\\n3.

Tôi hiểu câu hỏi của bạn là đánh giá tính khả thi của một dự án đầu tư có chi phí ban đầu 100 triệu VND và mang lại lợi nhuận 150 triệu VND sau 3 năm, với lãi suất thị trường là 8%/năm.  Dữ liệu được cung cấp chứa các ví dụ về phương pháp tính toán Giá trị hiện tại thuần (NPV) và Tỷ suất hoàn vốn nội bộ (IRR) để đánh giá dự án đầu tư, vì vậy tôi có thể giúp bạn giải quyết vấn đề này.\n",
